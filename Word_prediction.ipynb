              "\" emma by jane austen 1816   volume i  chapter i   emma woodhouse  handsome  clever  and rich  with a comfortable home and happy disposition  seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence  and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her   she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate  indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister  marriage  been mistress of his house from a very early period   her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short of a mother in affection   sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr  woodhouse  family  less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters  but particularly of emma   between  them  it was more the intimacy of sisters   even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached  and emma doing just what she liked  highly esteeming miss taylor  judgment  but directed chiefly by her own   the real evils  indeed  of emma  situation were the power of having rather too much her own way  and a disposition to think a little too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments   the danger  however  was at present so unperceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her   sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness   miss taylor married   it was miss taylor  loss which first brought grief   it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance   the wedding over  and the bride people gone  her father and herself were left to dine together  with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening   her father composed himself to sleep after dinner  as usual  and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost   the event had every promise of happiness for her friend   mr  weston was a man of unexceptionable character  easy fortune  suitable age  and pleasant manners  and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying  generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match  but it was a black morning  work for her  the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day  she recalled her past kindness  the kindness  the affection of sixteen years  how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old  how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health  and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood   a large debt of gratitude was owing here  but the intercourse of the last seven years  the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella  marriage  on their being left to each other  was yet a dearer  tenderer recollection  she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed  intelligent  well informed  useful  gentle  knowing all the ways of the family  interested in all its concerns  and peculiarly interested in herself  in every pleasure  every scheme of hers  one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose  and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault   how was she to bear the change   it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them  but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs  weston  only half a mile from them  and a miss taylor in the house  and with all her advantages  natural and domestic  she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude   she dearly loved her father  but he was no companion for her   he could not meet her in conversation  rational or playful   the evil of the actual disparity in their ages  and mr  woodhouse had not married early  was much increased by his constitution and habits  for having been a valetudinarian all his life  without activity of mind or body  he was a much older man in ways than in years  and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper  his talents could not have recommended him at any time   her sister  though comparatively but little removed by matrimony  being settled in london  only sixteen miles off  was much beyond her daily reach  and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield  before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband  and their little children  to fill the house  and give her pleasant society again   highbury  the large and populous village  almost amounting to a town  to which hartfield  in spite of its separate lawn  and shrubberies  and name  did really belong  afforded her no equals   the woodhouses were first in consequence there   all looked up to them   she had many acquaintance in the place  for her father was universally civil  but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day   it was a melancholy change  and emma could not but sigh over it  and wish for impossible things  till her father awoke  and made it necessary to be cheerful  his spirits required support   he was a nervous man  easily depressed  fond of every body that he was used to  and hating to part with them  hating change of every kind   matrimony  as the origin of change  was always disagreeable  and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter  marrying  nor could ever speak of her but with compassion  though it had been entirely a match of affection  when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too  and from his habits of gentle selfishness  and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself  he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them  and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield  emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could  to keep him from such thoughts  but when tea came  it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner    poor miss taylor!  i wish she were here again   what a pity it is that mr  weston ever thought of her!    i cannot agree with you  papa  you know i cannot   mr  weston is such a good humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves a good wife   and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own     a house of her own!  but where is the advantage of a house of her own  this is three times as large   and you have never any odd humours  my dear     how often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see us!  we shall be always meeting!  we  must begin  we must go and pay wedding visit very soon     my dear  how am i to get so far  randalls is such a distance  i could not walk half so far     no  papa  nobody thought of your walking   we must go in the carriage  to be sure     the carriage! but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way   and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit     they are to be put into mr  weston  stable  papa   you know we have settled all that already   we talked it all over with mr  weston last night   and as for james  you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls  because of his daughter  being housemaid there  i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else   that was your doing  papa   you got hannah that good place   nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her  james is so obliged to you!    i am very glad i did think of her   it was very lucky  for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account  and i am sure she will make a very good servant  she is a civil  pretty spoken girl  i have a great opinion of her   whenever i see her  she always curtseys and asks me how i do  in a very pretty manner  and when you have had her here to do needlework  i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it  i am sure she will be an excellent servant  and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see   whenever james goes over to see his daughter  you know  she will be hearing of us   he will be able to tell her how we all are    emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas  and hoped  by the help of backgammon  to get her father tolerably through the evening  and be attacked by no regrets but her own  the backgammon table was placed  but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary   mr  knightley  a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty  was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family  but particularly connected with it  as the elder brother of isabella  husband  he lived about a mile from highbury  was a frequent visitor  and always welcome  and at this time more welcome than usual  as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london   he had returned to a late dinner  after some days' absence  and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square  it was a happy circumstance  and animated mr  woodhouse for some time  mr  knightley had a cheerful manner  which always did him good  and his many inquiries after  poor isabella  and her children were answered most satisfactorily   when this was over  mr  woodhouse gratefully observed   it is very kind of you  mr  knightley  to come out at this late hour to call upon us   i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk     not at all  sir   it is a beautiful moonlight night  and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire     but you must have found it very damp and dirty   i wish you may not catch cold     dirty  sir! look at my shoes   not a speck on them     well! that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal of rain here   it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast   i wanted them to put off the wedding     by the bye  i have not wished you joy   being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  i have been in no hurry with my congratulations  but i hope it all went off tolerably well  how did you all behave  who cried most     ah! poor miss taylor! 'tis a sad business     poor mr  and miss woodhouse  if you please  but i cannot possibly say `poor miss taylor ' i have a great regard for you and emma  but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!  at any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two     especially when  one  of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature!  said emma playfully    that is what you have in your head  i know  and what you would certainly say if my father were not by     i believe it is very true  my dear  indeed   said mr  woodhouse  with a sigh    i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome     my dearest papa! you do not think i could mean  you   or suppose mr  knightley to mean  you    what a horrible idea! oh no! i meant only myself   mr  knightley loves to find fault with me  you know   in a joke  it is all a joke   we always say what we like to one another    mr  knightley  in fact  was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse  and the only one who ever told her of them  and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself  she knew it would be so much less so to her father  that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body    emma knows i never flatter her   said mr  knightley   but i meant no reflection on any body   miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please  she will now have but one  the chances are that she must be a gainer     well   said emma  willing to let it pass   you want to hear about the wedding  and i shall be happy to tell you  for we all behaved charmingly   every body was punctual  every body in their best looks  not a tear  and hardly a long face to be seen   oh no  we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart  and were sure of meeting every day     dear emma bears every thing so well   said her father   but  mr  knightley  she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor  and i am sure she  will  miss her more than she thinks for    emma turned away her head  divided between tears and smiles   it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion   said mr  knightley    we should not like her so well as we do  sir  if we could suppose it  but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor  advantage  she knows how very acceptable it must be  at miss taylor  time of life  to be settled in a home of her own  and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision  and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure  every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married     and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me   said emma   and a very considerable one  that i made the match myself  i made the match  you know  four years ago  and to have it take place  and be proved in the right  when so many people said mr  weston would never marry again  may comfort me for any thing    mr  knightley shook his head at her   her father fondly replied   ah! my dear  i wish you would not make matches and foretell things  for whatever you say always comes to pass   pray do not make any more matches     i promise you to make none for myself  papa  but i must  indeed  for other people   it is the greatest amusement in the world! and after such success  you know!  every body said that mr  weston would never marry again   oh dear  no! mr  weston  who had been a widower so long  and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife  so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here  always acceptable wherever he went  always cheerful   mr  weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it   oh no! mr  weston certainly would never marry again  some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed  and others of the son and the uncle not letting him   all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject  but i believed none of it    ever since the day  about four years ago  that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane  when  because it began to drizzle  he darted away with so much gallantry  and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell   i made up my mind on the subject  i planned the match from that hour  and when such success has blessed me in this instance  dear papa  you cannot think that i shall leave off match making     i do not understand what you mean by `success '  said mr  knightley   success supposes endeavour   your time has been properly and delicately spent  if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage   a worthy employment for a young lady  mind! but if  which i rather imagine  your making the match  as you call it  means only your planning it  your saying to yourself one idle day  `i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr  weston were to marry her ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards  why do you talk of success  where is your merit  what are you proud of  you made a lucky guess  and  that  is all that can be said     and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess    i pity you   i thought you cleverer  for  depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck   there is always some talent in it  and as to my poor word `success ' which you quarrel with  i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it   you have drawn two pretty pictures  but i think there may be a third  a something between the do nothing and the do all  if i had not promoted mr  weston  visits here  and given many little encouragements  and smoothed many little matters  it might not have come to any thing after all  i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that     a straightforward  open hearted man like weston  and a rational  unaffected woman like miss taylor  may be safely left to manage their own concerns   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself  than good to them  by interference     emma never thinks of herself  if she can do good to others   rejoined mr  woodhouse  understanding but in part    but  my dear  pray do not make any more matches  they are silly things  and break up one  family circle grievously     only one more  papa  only for mr  elton   poor mr  elton! you like mr  elton  papa   i must look about for a wife for him  there is nobody in highbury who deserves him  and he has been here a whole year  and has fitted up his house so comfortably  that it would be a shame to have him single any longer  and i thought when he was joining their hands to day  he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! i think very well of mr  elton  and this is the only way i have of doing him a service     mr  elton is a very pretty young man  to be sure  and a very good young man  and i have a great regard for him   but if you want to shew him any attention  my dear  ask him to come and dine with us some day   that will be a much better thing  i dare say mr  knightley will be so kind as to meet him     with a great deal of pleasure  sir  at any time   said mr  knightley  laughing   and i agree with you entirely  that it will be a much better thing   invite him to dinner  emma  and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken  but leave him to chuse his own wife  depend upon it  a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself      chapter ii   mr  weston was a native of highbury  and born of a respectable family  which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property   he had received a good education  but  on succeeding early in life to a small independence  had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged  and had satisfied an active  cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county  then embodied   captain weston was a general favourite  and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill  of a great yorkshire family  and miss churchill fell in love with him  nobody was surprized  except her brother and his wife  who had never seen him  and who were full of pride and importance  which the connexion would offend   miss churchill  however  being of age  and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage  and it took place  to the infinite mortification of mr  and mrs  churchill  who threw her off with due decorum   it was an unsuitable connexion  and did not produce much happiness   mrs  weston ought to have found more in it  for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him  but though she had one sort of spirit  she had not the best   she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother  but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother  unreasonable anger  nor from missing the luxuries of her former home   they lived beyond their income  but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe  she did not cease to love her husband  but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston  and miss churchill of enscombe   captain weston  who had been considered  especially by the churchills  as making such an amazing match  was proved to have much the worst of the bargain  for when his wife died  after a three years' marriage  he was rather a poorer man than at first  and with a child to maintain  from the expense of the child  however  he was soon relieved  the boy had  with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother   been the means of a sort of reconciliation  and mr  and mrs  churchill  having no children of their own  nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for  offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease  some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have felt  but as they were overcome by other considerations  the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills  and he had only his own comfort to seek  and his own situation to improve as he could   a complete change of life became desirable   he quitted the militia and engaged in trade  having brothers already established in a good way in london  which afforded him a favourable opening  it was a concern which brought just employment enough   he had still a small house in highbury  where most of his leisure days were spent  and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society  the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away  he had  by that time  realised an easy competence  enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury  which he had always longed for  enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor  and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition   it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth  it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls  and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to  but he had gone steadily on  with these objects in view  till they were accomplished   he had made his fortune  bought his house  and obtained his wife  and was beginning a new period of existence  with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through   he had never been an unhappy man  his own temper had secured him from that  even in his first marriage  but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be  and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen  to excite gratitude than to feel it   he had only himself to please in his choice  his fortune was his own  for as to frank  it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle  heir  it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age  it was most unlikely  therefore  that he should ever want his father  assistance   his father had no apprehension of it  the aunt was a capricious woman  and governed her husband entirely  but it was not in mr  weston  nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear  and  as he believed  so deservedly dear   he saw his son every year in london  and was proud of him  and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too  he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern   mr  frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury  and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed  though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life   his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved   now  upon his father  marriage  it was very generally proposed  as a most proper attention  that the visit should take place  there was not a dissentient voice on the subject  either when mrs  perry drank tea with mrs  and miss bates  or when mrs  and miss bates returned the visit   now was the time for mr  frank churchill to come among them  and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion  for a few days  every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs  weston had received    i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr  frank churchill has written to mrs  weston  i understand it was a very handsome letter  indeed  mr  woodhouse told me of it   mr  woodhouse saw the letter  and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life    it was  indeed  a highly prized letter   mrs  weston had  of course  formed a very favourable idea of the young man  and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense  and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured   she felt herself a most fortunate woman  and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought  where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled  and who could ill bear to part with her   she knew that at times she must be missed  and could not think  without pain  of emma  losing a single pleasure  or suffering an hour  ennui  from the want of her companionableness  but dear emma was of no feeble character  she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been  and had sense  and energy  and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations   and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield  so convenient for even solitary female walking  and in mr  weston  disposition and circumstances  which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together   her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs  weston  and of moments only of regret  and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment  was so just and so apparent  that emma  well as she knew her father  was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity `poor miss taylor ' when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort  or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own  but never did she go without mr  woodhouse  giving a gentle sigh  and saying   ah  poor miss taylor! she would be very glad to stay    there was no recovering miss taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her  but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr  woodhouse   the compliments of his neighbours were over  he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event  and the wedding cake  which had been a great distress to him  was all eat up   his own stomach could bear nothing rich  and he could never believe other people to be different from himself  what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body  and he had  therefore  earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all  and when that proved vain  as earnestly tried to prevent any body  eating it   he had been at the pains of consulting mr  perry  the apothecary  on the subject   mr  perry was an intelligent  gentlemanlike man  whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr  woodhouse  life  and upon being applied to  he could not but acknowledge  though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination  that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many  perhaps with most people  unless taken moderately  with such an opinion  in confirmation of his own  mr  woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair  but still the cake was eaten  and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone   there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs  weston  wedding cake in their hands  but mr  woodhouse would never believe it     chapter iii   mr  woodhouse was fond of society in his own way   he liked very much to have his friends come and see him  and from various united causes  from his long residence at hartfield  and his good nature  from his fortune  his house  and his daughter  he could command the visits of his own little circle  in a great measure  as he liked  he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle  his horror of late hours  and large dinner parties  made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms  fortunately for him  highbury  including randalls in the same parish  and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining  the seat of mr  knightley  comprehended many such   not unfrequently  through emma  persuasion  he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him  but evening parties were what he preferred  and  unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company  there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him   real  long standing regard brought the westons and mr  knightley  and by mr  elton  a young man living alone without liking it  the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr  woodhouse  drawing room  and the smiles of his lovely daughter  was in no danger of being thrown away   after these came a second set  among the most come at able of whom were mrs  and miss bates  and mrs  goddard  three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield  and who were fetched and carried home so often  that mr  woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses   had it taken place only once a year  it would have been a grievance   mrs  bates  the widow of a former vicar of highbury  was a very old lady  almost past every thing but tea and quadrille  she lived with her single daughter in a very small way  and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady  under such untoward circumstances  can excite   her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young  handsome  rich  nor married   miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour  and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself  or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect  she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness   her youth had passed without distinction  and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother  and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible   and yet she was a happy woman  and a woman whom no one named without good will   it was her own universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders  she loved every body  was interested in every body  happiness  quicksighted to every body  merits  thought herself a most fortunate creature  and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother  and so many good neighbours and friends  and a home that wanted for nothing   the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature  her contented and grateful spirit  were a recommendation to every body  and a mine of felicity to herself   she was a great talker upon little matters  which exactly suited mr  woodhouse  full of trivial communications and harmless gossip   mrs  goddard was the mistress of a school  not of a seminary  or an establishment  or any thing which professed  in long sentences of refined nonsense  to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality  upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real  honest  old fashioned boarding school  where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price  and where girls might be sent to be out of the way  and scramble themselves into a little education  without any danger of coming back prodigies   mrs  goddard  school was in high repute  and very deservedly  for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot  she had an ample house and garden  gave the children plenty of wholesome food  let them run about a great deal in the summer  and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands  it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church   she was a plain  motherly kind of woman  who had worked hard in her youth  and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea visit  and having formerly owed much to mr  woodhouse  kindness  felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour  hung round with fancy work  whenever she could  and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside   these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect  and happy was she  for her father  sake  in the power  though  as far as she was herself concerned  it was no remedy for the absence of mrs  weston   she was delighted to see her father look comfortable  and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well  but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated   as she sat one morning  looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day  a note was brought from mrs  goddard  requesting  in most respectful terms  to be allowed to bring miss smith with her  a most welcome request  for miss smith was a girl of seventeen  whom emma knew very well by sight  and had long felt an interest in  on account of her beauty   a very gracious invitation was returned  and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion   harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody   somebody had placed her  several years back  at mrs  goddard  school  and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder  this was all that was generally known of her history   she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury  and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her   she was a very pretty girl  and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired   she was short  plump  and fair  with a fine bloom  blue eyes  light hair  regular features  and a look of great sweetness  and  before the end of the evening  emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person  and quite determined to continue the acquaintance   she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith  conversation  but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy  not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing  shewing so proper and becoming a deference  seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield  and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to  that she must have good sense  and deserve encouragement   encouragement should be given  those soft blue eyes  and all those natural graces  should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions  the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her  the friends from whom she had just parted  though very good sort of people  must be doing her harm   they were a family of the name of martin  whom emma well knew by character  as renting a large farm of mr  knightley  and residing in the parish of donwell  very creditably  she believed  she knew mr  knightley thought highly of them  but they must be coarse and unpolished  and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect    she  would notice her  she would improve her  she would detach her from her bad acquaintance  and introduce her into good society  she would form her opinions and her manners  it would be an interesting  and certainly a very kind undertaking  highly becoming her own situation in life  her leisure  and powers   she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes  in talking and listening  and forming all these schemes in the in betweens  that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate  and the supper table  which always closed such parties  and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time  was all set out and ready  and moved forwards to the fire  before she was aware   with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively  with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas  did she then do all the honours of the meal  and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters  with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests   upon such occasions poor mr  woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare  he loved to have the cloth laid  because it had been the fashion of his youth  but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it  and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing  his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat   such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could  with thorough self approbation  recommend  though he might constrain himself  while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things  to say    mrs  bates  let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs  an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome   serle understands boiling an egg better than any body   i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else  but you need not be afraid  they are very small  you see  one of our small eggs will not hurt you   miss bates  let emma help you to a  little  bit of tart  a  very  little bit  ours are all apple tarts  you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here   i do not advise the custard   mrs  goddard  what say you to  half  a glass of wine  a  small  half glass  put into a tumbler of water  i do not think it could disagree with you    emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style  and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy   the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions   miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury  that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure  but the humble  grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings  delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening  and actually shaken hands with her at last!    chapter iv   harriet smith  intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing  quick and decided in her ways  emma lost no time in inviting  encouraging  and telling her to come very often  and as their acquaintance increased  so did their satisfaction in each other   as a walking companion  emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her  in that respect mrs  weston  loss had been important   her father never went beyond the shrubbery  where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk  or his short  as the year varied  and since mrs  weston  marriage her exercise had been too much confined  she had ventured once alone to randalls  but it was not pleasant  and a harriet smith  therefore  one whom she could summon at any time to a walk  would be a valuable addition to her privileges  but in every respect  as she saw more of her  she approved her  and was confirmed in all her kind designs   harriet certainly was not clever  but she had a sweet  docile  grateful disposition  was totally free from conceit  and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to   her early attachment to herself was very amiable  and her inclination for good company  and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever  shewed that there was no want of taste  though strength of understanding must not be expected   altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith  being exactly the young friend she wanted  exactly the something which her home required   such a friend as mrs  weston was out of the question   two such could never be granted  two such she did not want   it was quite a different sort of thing  a sentiment distinct and independent   mrs  weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem  harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful  for mrs  weston there was nothing to be done  for harriet every thing   her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents  but harriet could not tell   she was ready to tell every thing in her power  but on this subject questions were vain  emma was obliged to fancy what she liked  but she could never believe that in the same situation  she  should not have discovered the truth   harriet had no penetration   she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs  goddard chose to tell her  and looked no farther   mrs  goddard  and the teachers  and the girls and the affairs of the school in general  formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm  it must have been the whole   but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal  she had spent two very happy months with them  and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit  and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place   emma encouraged her talkativeness  amused by such a picture of another set of beings  and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs  martin  having   two  parlours  two very good parlours  indeed  one of them quite as large as mrs  goddard  drawing room  and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her  and of their having eight cows  two of them alderneys  and one a little welch cow  a very pretty little welch cow indeed  and of mrs  martin  saying as she was so fond of it  it should be called  her  cow  and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden  where some day next year they were all to drink tea   a very handsome summer house  large enough to hold a dozen people    for some time she was amused  without thinking beyond the immediate cause  but as she came to understand the family better  other feelings arose  she had taken up a wrong idea  fancying it was a mother and daughter  a son and son  wife  who all lived together  but when it appeared that the mr  martin  who bore a part in the narrative  and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something or other  was a single man  that there was no young mrs  martin  no wife in the case  she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness  and that  if she were not taken care of  she might be required to sink herself forever   with this inspiriting notion  her questions increased in number and meaning  and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr  martin  and there was evidently no dislike to it   harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging   he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts  because she had said how fond she was of them  and in every thing else he was so very obliging   he had his shepherd  son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her  she was very fond of singing   he could sing a little himself  she believed he was very clever  and understood every thing  he had a very fine flock  and  while she was with them  he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country  she believed every body spoke well of him   his mother and sisters were very fond of him   mrs  martin had told her one day  and there was a blush as she said it   that it was impossible for any body to be a better son  and therefore she was sure  whenever he married  he would make a good husband   not that she  wanted  him to marry  she was in no hurry at all    well done  mrs  martin!  thought emma    you know what you are about     and when she had come away  mrs  martin was so very kind as to send mrs  goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose mrs  goddard had ever seen   mrs  goddard had dressed it on a sunday  and asked all the three teachers  miss nash  and miss prince  and miss richardson  to sup with her     mr  martin  i suppose  is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business  he does not read     oh yes!  that is  no  i do not know  but i believe he has read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of  he reads the agricultural reports  and some other books that lay in one of the window seats  but he reads all  them  to himself  but sometimes of an evening  before we went to cards  he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts  very entertaining  and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield   he never read the romance of the forest  nor the children of the abbey   he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them  but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can    the next question was     what sort of looking man is mr  martin     oh! not handsome  not at all handsome   i thought him very plain at first  but i do not think him so plain now   one does not  you know  after a time   but did you never see him  he is in highbury every now and then  and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston   he has passed you very often     that may be  and i may have seen him fifty times  but without having any idea of his name   a young farmer  whether on horseback or on foot  is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity  the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do   a degree or two lower  and a creditable appearance might interest me  i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other   but a farmer can need none of my help  and is  therefore  in one sense  as much above my notice as in every other he is below it     to be sure   oh yes! it is not likely you should ever have observed him  but he knows you very well indeed  i mean by sight     i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man  i know  indeed  that he is so  and  as such  wish him well  what do you imagine his age to be     he was four and twenty the 8th of last june  and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day  difference  which is very odd     only four and twenty  that is too young to settle   his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry   they seem very comfortable as they are  and if she were to take any pains to marry him  she would probably repent it   six years hence  if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own  with a little money  it might be very desirable     six years hence! dear miss woodhouse  he would be thirty years old!    well  and that is as early as most men can afford to marry  who are not born to an independence   mr  martin  i imagine  has his fortune entirely to make  cannot be at all beforehand with the world   whatever money he might come into when his father died  whatever his share of the family property  it is  i dare say  all afloat  all employed in his stock  and so forth  and though  with diligence and good luck  he may be rich in time  it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet     to be sure  so it is   but they live very comfortably  they have no indoors man  else they do not want for any thing  and mrs  martin talks of taking a boy another year     i wish you may not get into a scrape  harriet  whenever he does marry   i mean  as to being acquainted with his wife  for though his sisters  from a superior education  are not to be altogether objected to  it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice   the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates   there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman  daughter  and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power  or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you     yes  to be sure  i suppose there are   but while i visit at hartfield  and you are so kind to me  miss woodhouse  i am not afraid of what any body can do     you understand the force of influence pretty well  harriet  but i would have you so firmly established in good society  as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse   i want to see you permanently well connected  and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be  and  therefore  i say that if you should still be in this country when mr  martin marries  i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters  to be acquainted with the wife  who will probably be some mere farmer  daughter  without education     to be sure   yes   not that i think mr  martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education  and been very well brought up  however  i do not mean to set up my opinion against your   and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife   i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins  especially elizabeth  and should be very sorry to give them up  for they are quite as well educated as me   but if he marries a very ignorant  vulgar woman  certainly i had better not visit her  if i can help it    emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech  and saw no alarming symptoms of love   the young man had been the first admirer  but she trusted there was no other hold  and that there would be no serious difficulty  on harriet  side  to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own   they met mr  martin the very next day  as they were walking on the donwell road   he was on foot  and after looking very respectfully at her  looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion  emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey  and walking a few yards forward  while they talked together  soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr  robert martin  his appearance was very neat  and he looked like a sensible young man  but his person had no other advantage  and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen  she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet  inclination   harriet was not insensible of manner  she had voluntarily noticed her father  gentleness with admiration as well as wonder   mr  martin looked as if he did not know what manner was   they remained but a few minutes together  as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting  and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face  and in a flutter of spirits  which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose    only think of our happening to meet him!  how very odd! it was quite a chance  he said  that he had not gone round by randalls  he did not think we ever walked this road   he thought we walked towards randalls most days   he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet   he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it  but he goes again to morrow  so very odd we should happen to meet! well  miss woodhouse  is he like what you expected  what do you think of him  do you think him so very plain     he is very plain  undoubtedly  remarkably plain   but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility   i had no right to expect much  and i did not expect much  but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish  so totally without air  i had imagined him  i confess  a degree or two nearer gentility     to be sure   said harriet  in a mortified voice   he is not so genteel as real gentlemen     i think  harriet  since your acquaintance with us  you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen  that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr  martin  at hartfield  you have had very good specimens of well educated  well bred men   i should be surprized if  after seeing them  you could be in company with mr  martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature  and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before  do not you begin to feel that now  were not you struck  i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner  and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here     certainly  he is not like mr  knightley   he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr  knightley   i see the difference plain enough   but mr  knightley is so very fine a man!    mr  knightley  air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr  martin with  him    you might not see one in a hundred with  gentleman  so plainly written as in mr  knightley   but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to   what say you to mr  weston and mr  elton  compare mr  martin with either of  them   compare their manner of carrying themselves  of walking  of speaking  of being silent   you must see the difference     oh yes!  there is a great difference   but mr  weston is almost an old man   mr  weston must be between forty and fifty     which makes his good manners the more valuable   the older a person grows  harriet  the more important it is that their manners should not be bad  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness  or coarseness  or awkwardness becomes   what is passable in youth is detestable in later age   mr  martin is now awkward and abrupt  what will he be at mr  weston  time of life     there is no saying  indeed   replied harriet rather solemnly    but there may be pretty good guessing   he will be a completely gross  vulgar farmer  totally inattentive to appearances  and thinking of nothing but profit and loss     will he  indeed  that will be very bad     how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended  he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else  which is just as it should be  for a thriving man   what has he to do with books  and i have no doubt that he  will  thrive  and be a very rich man in time  and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb  us      i wonder he did not remember the book   was all harriet  answer  and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself   she  therefore  said no more for some time  her next beginning was    in one respect  perhaps  mr  elton  manners are superior to mr  knightley  or mr  weston   they have more gentleness  they might be more safely held up as a pattern   there is an openness  a quickness  almost a bluntness in mr  weston  which every body likes in  him   because there is so much good humour with it  but that would not do to be copied   neither would mr  knightley  downright  decided  commanding sort of manner  though it suits  him  very well  his figure  and look  and situation in life seem to allow it  but if any young man were to set about copying him  he would not be sufferable   on the contrary  i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr  elton as a model  mr  elton is good humoured  cheerful  obliging  and gentle  he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late   i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us  harriet  by additional softness  but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be   if he means any thing  it must be to please you   did not i tell you what he said of you the other day    she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr  elton  and now did full justice to  and harriet blushed and smiled  and said she had always thought mr  elton very agreeable   mr  elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet  head   she thought it would be an excellent match  and only too palpably desirable  natural  and probable  for her to have much merit in planning it  she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict  it was not likely  however  that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan  as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet  coming to hartfield   the longer she considered it  the greater was her sense of its expediency  mr  elton  situation was most suitable  quite the gentleman himself  and without low connexions  at the same time  not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet   he had a comfortable home for her  and emma imagined a very sufficient income  for though the vicarage of highbury was not large  he was known to have some independent property  and she thought very highly of him as a good humoured  well meaning  respectable young man  without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world   she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl  which she trusted  with such frequent meetings at hartfield  was foundation enough on his side  and on harriet  there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy   and he was really a very pleasing young man  a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like  he was reckoned very handsome  his person much admired in general  though not by her  there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with   but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin  riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr  elton  admiration     chapter v    i do not know what your opinion may be  mrs  weston   said mr  knightley   of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith  but i think it a bad thing     a bad thing! do you really think it a bad thing   why so     i think they will neither of them do the other any good     you surprize me! emma must do harriet good  and by supplying her with a new object of interest  harriet may be said to do emma good  i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure  how very differently we feel!  not think they will do each other any good! this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma  mr  knightley     perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you  knowing weston to be out  and that you must still fight your own battle     mr  weston would undoubtedly support me  if he were here  for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject   we were speaking of it only yesterday  and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma  that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with  mr  knightley  i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case  you are so much used to live alone  that you do not know the value of a companion  and  perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex  after being used to it all her life   i can imagine your objection to harriet smith  she is not the superior young woman which emma  friend ought to be  but on the other hand  as emma wants to see her better informed  it will be an inducement to her to read more herself   they will read together   she means it  i know     emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old   i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through  and very good lists they were  very well chosen  and very neatly arranged  sometimes alphabetically  and sometimes by some other rule  the list she drew up when only fourteen  i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit  that i preserved it some time  and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now   but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma  she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience  and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding   where miss taylor failed to stimulate  i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing   you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished   you know you could not     i dare say   replied mrs  weston  smiling   that i thought so  then    but since we have parted  i can never remember emma  omitting to do any thing i wished     there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as  that     said mr  knightley  feelingly  and for a moment or two he had done    but i   he soon added   who have had no such charm thrown over my senses  must still see  hear  and remember   emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family   at ten years old  she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen  she was always quick and assured  isabella slow and diffident  and ever since she was twelve  emma has been mistress of the house and of you all   in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her   she inherits her mother  talents  and must have been under subjection to her     i should have been sorry  mr  knightley  to be dependent on  your  recommendation  had i quitted mr  woodhouse  family and wanted another situation  i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body   i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held     yes   said he  smiling    you are better placed  here   very fit for a wife  but not at all for a governess   but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield  you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise  but you were receiving a very good education from  her   on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will  and doing as you were bid  and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife  i should certainly have named miss taylor     thank you   there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr  weston     why  to own the truth  i am afraid you are rather thrown away  and that with every disposition to bear  there will be nothing to be borne   we will not despair  however   weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort  or his son may plague him     i hope not  that    it is not likely   no  mr  knightley  do not foretell vexation from that quarter     not i  indeed   i only name possibilities   i do not pretend to emma  genius for foretelling and guessing   i hope  with all my heart  the young man may be a weston in merit  and a churchill in fortune   but harriet smith  i have not half done about harriet smith   i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have  she knows nothing herself  and looks upon emma as knowing every thing  she is a flatterer in all her ways  and so much the worse  because undesigned   her ignorance is hourly flattery   how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself  while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority  and as for harriet  i will venture to say that  she  cannot gain by the acquaintance  hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to   she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home  i am much mistaken if emma  doctrines give any strength of mind  or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life   they only give a little polish     i either depend more upon emma  good sense than you do  or am more anxious for her present comfort  for i cannot lament the acquaintance  how well she looked last night!    oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind  would you  very well  i shall not attempt to deny emma  being pretty     pretty! say beautiful rather   can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether  face and figure     i do not know what i could imagine  but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers  but i am a partial old friend     such an eye!  the true hazle eye  and so brilliant! regular features  open countenance  with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health  and such a pretty height and size  such a firm and upright figure! there is health  not merely in her bloom  but in her air  her head  her glance   one hears sometimes of a child being `the picture of health ' now  emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health   she is loveliness itself   mr  knightley  is not she     i have not a fault to find with her person   he replied   i think her all you describe   i love to look at her  and i will add this praise  that i do not think her personally vain  considering how very handsome she is  she appears to be little occupied with it  her vanity lies another way   mrs  weston  i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith  or my dread of its doing them both harm     and i  mr  knightley  am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm   with all dear emma  little faults  she is an excellent creature   where shall we see a better daughter  or a kinder sister  or a truer friend  no  no  she has qualities which may be trusted  she will never lead any one really wrong  she will make no lasting blunder  where emma errs once  she is in the right a hundred times     very well  i will not plague you any more   emma shall be an angel  and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella   john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection  and isabella always thinks as he does  except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children  i am sure of having their opinions with me     i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind  but excuse me  mr  knightley  if i take the liberty  i consider myself  you know  as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma  mother might have had  the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith  intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you   pray excuse me  but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy  it cannot be expected that emma  accountable to nobody but her father  who perfectly approves the acquaintance  should put an end to it  so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself   it has been so many years my province to give advice  that you cannot be surprized  mr  knightley  at this little remains of office     not at all   cried he   i am much obliged to you for it  it is very good advice  and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found  for it shall be attended to     mrs  john knightley is easily alarmed  and might be made unhappy about her sister     be satisfied   said he   i will not raise any outcry   i will keep my ill humour to myself   i have a very sincere interest in emma  isabella does not seem more my sister  has never excited a greater interest  perhaps hardly so great   there is an anxiety  a curiosity in what one feels for emma   i wonder what will become of her!    so do i   said mrs  weston gently   very much     she always declares she will never marry  which  of course  means just nothing at all   but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for   it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object   i should like to see emma in love  and in some doubt of a return  it would do her good  but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her  and she goes so seldom from home     there does  indeed  seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present   said mrs  weston   as can well be  and while she is so happy at hartfield  i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr  woodhouse  account   i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma  though i mean no slight to the state  i assure you    part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr  weston  on the subject  as much as possible  there were wishes at randalls respecting emma  destiny  but it was not desirable to have them suspected  and the quiet transition which mr  knightley soon afterwards made to  what does weston think of the weather  shall we have rain   convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield     chapter vi   emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet  fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose  for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr  elton  being a remarkably handsome man  with most agreeable manners  and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints  she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet  side  as there could be any occasion for   she was quite convinced of mr  elton  being in the fairest way of falling in love  if not in love already   she had no scruple with regard to him  he talked of harriet  and praised her so warmly  that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add  his perception of the striking improvement of harriet  manner  since her introduction at hartfield  was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment    you have given miss smith all that she required   said he   you have made her graceful and easy   she was a beautiful creature when she came to you  but  in my opinion  the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature     i am glad you think i have been useful to her  but harriet only wanted drawing out  and receiving a few  very few hints  she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself   i have done very little     if it were admissible to contradict a lady   said the gallant mr  elton     i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character  have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before     exactly so  that is what principally strikes me   so much superadded decision of character! skilful has been the hand!    great has been the pleasure  i am sure   i never met with a disposition more truly amiable     i have no doubt of it   and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation  which had a vast deal of the lover  she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers  to have harriet  picture    did you ever have your likeness taken  harriet   said she   did you ever sit for your picture    harriet was on the point of leaving the room  and only stopt to say  with a very interesting naivete    oh! dear  no  never    no sooner was she out of sight  than emma exclaimed    what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! i would give any money for it   i almost long to attempt her likeness myself  you do not know it i dare say  but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses  and attempted several of my friends  and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general  but from one cause or another  i gave it up in disgust  but really  i could almost venture  if harriet would sit to me  it would be such a delight to have her picture!    let me entreat you   cried mr  elton   it would indeed be a delight! let me entreat you  miss woodhouse  to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend   i know what your drawings are  how could you suppose me ignorant  is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers  and has not mrs  weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room  at randalls    yes  good man!  thought emma  but what has all that to do with taking likenesses  you know nothing of drawing   don't pretend to be in raptures about mine   keep your raptures for harriet  face   well  if you give me such kind encouragement  mr  elton  i believe i shall try what i can do   harriet  features are very delicate  which makes a likeness difficult  and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch     exactly so  the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  i have not a doubt of your success   pray  pray attempt it  as you will do it  it will indeed  to use your own words  be an exquisite possession     but i am afraid  mr  elton  harriet will not like to sit  she thinks so little of her own beauty   did not you observe her manner of answering me  how completely it meant  `why should my picture be drawn '    oh! yes  i observed it  i assure you   it was not lost on me  but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded    harriet was soon back again  and the proposal almost immediately made  and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others   emma wished to go to work directly  and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits  for not one of them had ever been finished  that they might decide together on the best size for harriet   her many beginnings were displayed   miniatures  half lengths  whole lengths  pencil  crayon  and water colours had been all tried in turn  she had always wanted to do every thing  and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to   she played and sang   and drew in almost every style  but steadiness had always been wanting  and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command  and ought not to have failed of  she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician  but she was not unwilling to have others deceived  or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved   there was merit in every drawing  in the least finished  perhaps the most  her style was spirited  but had there been much less  or had there been ten times more  the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same   they were both in ecstasies   a likeness pleases every body  and miss woodhouse  performances must be capital    no great variety of faces for you   said emma    i had only my own family to study from   there is my father  another of my father  but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous  that i could only take him by stealth  neither of them very like therefore   mrs  weston again  and again  and again  you see  dear mrs  weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion  she would sit whenever i asked her   there is my sister  and really quite her own little elegant figure!  and the face not unlike  i should have made a good likeness of her  if she would have sat longer  but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet   then  here come all my attempts at three of those four children   there they are  henry and john and bella  from one end of the sheet to the other  and any one of them might do for any one of the rest   she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse  but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know  nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them  beyond the air and complexion  unless they are coarser featured than any of mama  children ever were   here is my sketch of the fourth  who was a baby   i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa  and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see  he had nestled down his head most conveniently   that  very like  i am rather proud of little george   the corner of the sofa is very good  then here is my last    unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size  whole length   my last and my best  my brother  mr  john knightley   this did not want much of being finished  when i put it away in a pet  and vowed i would never take another likeness  i could not help being provoked  for after all my pains  and when i had really made a very good likeness of it   mrs  weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it  very  like   only too handsome  too flattering  but that was a fault on the right side  after all this  came poor dear isabella  cold approbation of   yes  it was a little like  but to be sure it did not do him justice   we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all  it was made a great favour of  and altogether it was more than i could bear  and so i never would finish it  to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness  to every morning visitor in brunswick square   and  as i said  i did then forswear ever drawing any body again   but for harriet  sake  or rather for my own  and as there are no husbands and wives in the case  at   present   i will break my resolution now    mr  elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea  and was repeating   no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed  as you observe   exactly so   no husbands and wives   with so interesting a consciousness  that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once   but as she wanted to be drawing  the declaration must wait a little longer   she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait  it was to be a whole length in water colours  like mr  john knightley   and was destined  if she could please herself  to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece   the sitting began  and harriet  smiling and blushing  and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance  presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist  but there was no doing any thing  with mr  elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch   she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence  but was really obliged to put an end to it  and request him to place himself elsewhere   it then occurred to her to employ him in reading    if he would be so good as to read to them  it would be a kindness indeed! it would amuse away the difficulties of her part  and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith     mr  elton was only too happy   harriet listened  and emma drew in peace   she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look  any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover  and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil  to jump up and see the progress  and be charmed   there was no being displeased with such an encourager  for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible  she could not respect his eye  but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable   the sitting was altogether very satisfactory  she was quite enough pleased with the first day  sketch to wish to go on  there was no want of likeness  she had been fortunate in the attitude  and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure  to give a little more height  and considerably more elegance  she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last  and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both  a standing memorial of the beauty of one  the skill of the other  and the friendship of both  with as many other agreeable associations as mr  elton  very promising attachment was likely to add   harriet was to sit again the next day  and mr  elton  just as he ought  entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again    by all means   we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party    the same civilities and courtesies  the same success and satisfaction  took place on the morrow  and accompanied the whole progress of the picture  which was rapid and happy   every body who saw it was pleased  but mr  elton was in continual raptures  and defended it through every criticism    miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted    observed mrs  weston to him  not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover    the expression of the eye is most correct  but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes  it is the fault of her face that she has them not     do you think so   replied he    i cannot agree with you  it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature  i never saw such a likeness in my life   we must allow for the effect of shade  you know     you have made her too tall  emma   said mr  knightley   emma knew that she had  but would not own it  and mr  elton warmly added    oh no! certainly not too tall  not in the least too tall   consider  she is sitting down  which naturally presents a different  which in short gives exactly the idea  and the proportions must be preserved  you know   proportions  fore shortening   oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith   exactly so indeed!    it is very pretty   said mr  woodhouse    so prettily done! just as your drawings always are  my dear   i do not know any body who draws so well as you do   the only thing i do not thoroughly like is  that she seems to be sitting out of doors  with only a little shawl over her shoulders  and it makes one think she must catch cold     but  my dear papa  it is supposed to be summer  a warm day in summer  look at the tree     but it is never safe to sit out of doors  my dear     you  sir  may say any thing   cried mr  elton   but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought  the placing of miss smith out of doors  and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! any other situation would have been much less in character  the naivete of miss smith  manners  and altogether  oh  it is most admirable! i cannot keep my eyes from it   i never saw such a likeness    the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed  and here were a few difficulties   it must be done directly  it must be done in london  the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on  and isabella  the usual doer of all commissions  must not be applied to  because it was december  and mr  woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december   but no sooner was the distress known to mr  elton  than it was removed   his gallantry was always on the alert   might he be trusted with the commission  what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to london at any time  it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand     he was too good!  she could not endure the thought!  she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world    brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances   and a very few minutes settled the business   mr  elton was to take the drawing to london  chuse the frame  and give the directions  and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him  while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough    what a precious deposit!  said he with a tender sigh  as he received it    this man is almost too gallant to be in love   thought emma   i should say so  but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love   he is an excellent young man  and will suit harriet exactly  it will be an `exactly so ' as he says himself  but he does sigh and languish  and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal   i come in for a pretty good share as a second   but it is his gratitude on harriet  account      chapter vii   the very day of mr  elton  going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma  services towards her friend   harriet had been at hartfield  as usual  soon after breakfast  and  after a time  had gone home to return again to dinner  she returned  and sooner than had been talked of  and with an agitated  hurried look  announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell  half a minute brought it all out   she had heard  as soon as she got back to mrs  goddard   that mr  martin had been there an hour before  and finding she was not at home  nor particularly expected  had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters  and gone away  and on opening this parcel  she had actually found  besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy  a letter to herself  and this letter was from him  from mr  martin  and contained a direct proposal of marriage    who could have thought it  she was so surprized she did not know what to do   yes  quite a proposal of marriage  and a very good letter  at least she thought so   and he wrote as if he really loved her very much  but she did not know  and so  she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do     emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful    upon my word   she cried   the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking   he will connect himself well if he can     will you read the letter   cried harriet    pray do   i'd rather you would    emma was not sorry to be pressed   she read  and was surprized  the style of the letter was much above her expectation  there were not merely no grammatical errors  but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman  the language  though plain  was strong and unaffected  and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer   it was short  but expressed good sense  warm attachment  liberality  propriety  even delicacy of feeling  she paused over it  while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion  with a  well  well   and was at last forced to add   is it a good letter  or is it too short     yes  indeed  a very good letter   replied emma rather slowly   so good a letter  harriet  that every thing considered  i think one of his sisters must have helped him   i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well  if left quite to his own powers  and yet it is not the style of a woman  no  certainly  it is too strong and concise  not diffuse enough for a woman   no doubt he is a sensible man  and i suppose may have a natural talent for  thinks strongly and clearly  and when he takes a pen in hand  his thoughts naturally find proper words   it is so with some men   yes  i understand the sort of mind   vigorous  decided  with sentiments to a certain point  not coarse   a better written letter  harriet  returning it   than i had expected     well   said the still waiting harriet    well  and  and what shall i do     what shall you do! in what respect  do you mean with regard to this letter     yes     but what are you in doubt of  you must answer it of course  and speedily     yes  but what shall i say  dear miss woodhouse  do advise me     oh no  no! the letter had much better be all your own   you will express yourself very properly  i am sure   there is no danger of your not being intelligible  which is the first thing   your meaning must be unequivocal  no doubts or demurs  and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires  will present themselves unbidden to  your  mind  i am persuaded  you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment     you think i ought to refuse him then   said harriet  looking down    ought to refuse him! my dear harriet  what do you mean  are you in any doubt as to that  i thought  but i beg your pardon  perhaps i have been under a mistake   i certainly have been misunderstanding you  if you feel in doubt as to the  purport  of your answer  i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it    harriet was silent   with a little reserve of manner  emma continued    you mean to return a favourable answer  i collect     no  i do not  that is  i do not mean  what shall i do  what would you advise me to do  pray  dear miss woodhouse  tell me what i ought to do     i shall not give you any advice  harriet   i will have nothing to do with it   this is a point which you must settle with your feelings     i had no notion that he liked me so very much   said harriet  contemplating the letter   for a little while emma persevered in her silence  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful  she thought it best to say    i lay it down as a general rule  harriet  that if a woman  doubts  as to whether she should accept a man or not  she certainly ought to refuse him   if she can hesitate as to `yes ' she ought to say `no' directly   it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings  with half a heart   i thought it my duty as a friend  and older than yourself  to say thus much to you  but do not imagine that i want to influence you     oh! no  i am sure you are a great deal too kind to  but if you would just advise me what i had best do  no  no  i do not mean that  as you say  one  mind ought to be quite made up  one should not be hesitating  it is a very serious thing   it will be safer to say `no ' perhaps   do you think i had better say `no '    not for the world   said emma  smiling graciously   would i advise you either way   you must be the best judge of your own happiness  if you prefer mr  martin to every other person  if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with  why should you hesitate  you blush  harriet   does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition  harriet  harriet  do not deceive yourself  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion  at this moment whom are you thinking of    the symptoms were favourable   instead of answering  harriet turned away confused  and stood thoughtfully by the fire  and though the letter was still in her hand  it was now mechanically twisted about without regard   emma waited the result with impatience  but not without strong hopes   at last  with some hesitation  harriet said     miss woodhouse  as you will not give me your opinion  i must do as well as i can by myself  and i have now quite determined  and really almost made up my mind  to refuse mr  martin   do you think i am right     perfectly  perfectly right  my dearest harriet  you are doing just what you ought   while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself  but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving   dear harriet  i give myself joy of this  it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance  which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr  martin   while you were in the smallest degree wavering  i said nothing about it  because i would not influence  but it would have been the loss of a friend to me  i could not have visited mrs  robert martin  of abbey mill farm  now i am secure of you for ever    harriet had not surmised her own danger  but the idea of it struck her forcibly    you could not have visited me!  she cried  looking aghast   no  to be sure you could not  but i never thought of that before  that would have been too dreadful!  what an escape!  dear miss woodhouse  i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world     indeed  harriet  it would have been a severe pang to lose you  but it must have been   you would have thrown yourself out of all good society   i must have given you up     dear me!  how should i ever have borne it! it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more!    dear affectionate creature!   you  banished to abbey mill farm!   you  confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it  he must have a pretty good opinion of himself     i do not think he is conceited either  in general   said harriet  her conscience opposing such censure   at least  he is very good natured  and i shall always feel much obliged to him  and have a great regard for  but that is quite a different thing from  and you know  though he may like me  it does not follow that i should  and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people  and if one comes to compare them  person and manners  there is no comparison at all   one  is so very handsome and agreeable  however  i do really think mr  martin a very amiable young man  and have a great opinion of him  and his being so much attached to me  and his writing such a letter  but as to leaving you  it is what i would not do upon any consideration     thank you  thank you  my own sweet little friend   we will not be parted   a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked  or because he is attached to her  and can write a tolerable letter     oh no   and it is but a short letter too    emma felt the bad taste of her friend  but let it pass with a  very true  and it would be a small consolation to her  for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day  to know that her husband could write a good letter     oh! yes  very   nobody cares for a letter  the thing is  to be always happy with pleasant companions   i am quite determined to refuse him  but how shall i do  what shall i say    emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer  and advised its being written directly  which was agreed to  in the hope of her assistance  and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted  it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence   the looking over his letter again  in replying to it  had such a softening tendency  that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions  and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy  and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say  and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful  that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment  he would have been accepted after all   this letter  however  was written  and sealed  and sent  the business was finished  and harriet safe   she was rather low all the evening  but emma could allow for her amiable regrets  and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection  sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr  elton    i shall never be invited to abbey mill again   was said in rather a sorrowful tone    nor  if you were  could i ever bear to part with you  my harriet  you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill     and i am sure i should never want to go there  for i am never happy but at hartfield    some time afterwards it was   i think mrs  goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened   i am sure miss nash would  for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married  and it is only a linen draper     one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school  harriet   i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married   even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes   as to any thing superior for you  i suppose she is quite in the dark   the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet  hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves    harriet blushed and smiled  and said something about wondering that people should like her so much   the idea of mr  elton was certainly cheering  but still  after a time  she was tender hearted again towards the rejected mr  martin    now he has got my letter   said she softly    i wonder what they are all doing  whether his sisters know  if he is unhappy  they will be unhappy too   i hope he will not mind it so very much     let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed   cried emma    at this moment  perhaps  mr  elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters  telling how much more beautiful is the original  and after being asked for it five or six times  allowing them to hear your name  your own dear name     my picture!  but he has left my picture in bond street     has he so!  then i know nothing of mr  elton   no  my dear little modest harriet  depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow  it is his companion all this evening  his solace  his delight  it opens his designs to his family  it introduces you among them  it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature  eager curiosity and warm prepossession   how cheerful  how animated  how suspicious  how busy their imaginations all are!   harriet smiled again  and her smiles grew stronger     chapter viii   harriet slept at hartfield that night   for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there  and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself  and emma judged it best in every respect  safest and kindest  to keep her with them as much as possible just at present   she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs  goddard   but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield  to make a regular visit of some days   while she was gone  mr  knightley called  and sat some time with mr  woodhouse and emma  till mr  woodhouse  who had previously made up his mind to walk out  was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it  and was induced by the entreaties of both  though against the scruples of his own civility  to leave mr  knightley for that purpose  mr  knightley  who had nothing of ceremony about him  was offering by his short  decided answers  an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other    well  i believe  if you will excuse me  mr  knightley  if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing  i shall take emma  advice and go out for a quarter of an hour   as the sun is out  i believe i had better take my three turns while i can  i treat you without ceremony  mr  knightley   we invalids think we are privileged people     my dear sir  do not make a stranger of me     i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter   emma will be happy to entertain you   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns  my winter walk     you cannot do better  sir     i would ask for the pleasure of your company  mr  knightley  but i am a very slow walker  and my pace would be tedious to you  and  besides  you have another long walk before you  to donwell abbey     thank you  sir  thank you  i am going this moment myself  and i think the sooner  you  go the better   i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you    mr  woodhouse at last was off  but mr  knightley  instead of being immediately off likewise  sat down again  seemingly inclined for more chat   he began speaking of harriet  and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before    i cannot rate her beauty as you do   said he   but she is a pretty little creature  and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition   her character depends upon those she is with  but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman     i am glad you think so  and the good hands  i hope  may not be wanting     come   said he   you are anxious for a compliment  so i will tell you that you have improved her   you have cured her of her school girl  giggle  she really does you credit     thank you   i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use  but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may    you  do not often overpower me with it     you are expecting her again  you say  this morning     almost every moment   she has been gone longer already than she intended     something has happened to delay her  some visitors perhaps     highbury gossips!  tiresome wretches!    harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would    emma knew this was too true for contradiction  and therefore said nothing   he presently added  with a smile    i do not pretend to fix on times or places  but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage     indeed! how so  of what sort     a very serious sort  i assure you   still smiling    very serious! i can think of but one thing  who is in love with her  who makes you their confidant    emma was more than half in hopes of mr  elton  having dropt a hint  mr  knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser  and she knew mr  elton looked up to him    i have reason to think   he replied   that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage  and from a most unexceptionable quarter   robert martin is the man   her visit to abbey mill  this summer  seems to have done his business   he is desperately in love and means to marry her     he is very obliging   said emma   but is he sure that harriet means to marry him     well  well  means to make her an offer then   will that do  he came to the abbey two evenings ago  on purpose to consult me about it  he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family  and  i believe  considers me as one of his best friends   he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early  whether i thought her too young  in short  whether i approved his choice altogether  having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered  especially since  your  making so much of her  as in a line of society above him   i was very much pleased with all that he said  i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin  he always speaks to the purpose  open  straightforward  and very well judging   he told me every thing  his circumstances and plans  and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage   he is an excellent young man  both as son and brother   i had no hesitation in advising him to marry   he proved to me that he could afford it  and that being the case  i was convinced he could not do better  i praised the fair lady too  and altogether sent him away very happy  if he had never esteemed my opinion before  he would have thought highly of me then  and  i dare say  left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had   this happened the night before last   now  as we may fairly suppose  he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady  and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday  it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs  goddard  to day  and she may be detained by a visitor  without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch     pray  mr  knightley   said emma  who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech   how do you know that mr  martin did not speak yesterday     certainly   replied he  surprized   i do not absolutely know it  but it may be inferred   was not she the whole day with you     come   said she   i will tell you something  in return for what you have told me   he did speak yesterday  that is  he wrote  and was refused    this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed  and mr  knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure  as he stood up  in tall indignation  and said    then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her  what is the foolish girl about     oh! to be sure   cried emma   it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage  a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her     nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing   but what is the meaning of this  harriet smith refuse robert martin  madness  if it is so  but i hope you are mistaken     i saw her answer!  nothing could be clearer     you saw her answer!  you wrote her answer too   emma  this is your doing   you persuaded her to refuse him     and if i did   which  however  i am far from allowing  i should not feel that i had done wrong   mr  martin is a very respectable young man  but i cannot admit him to be harriet  equal  and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her  by your account  he does seem to have had some scruples   it is a pity that they were ever got over     not harriet  equal!  exclaimed mr  knightley loudly and warmly  and with calmer asperity  added  a few moments afterwards   no  he is not her equal indeed  for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation   emma  your infatuation about that girl blinds you  what are harriet smith  claims  either of birth  nature or education  to any connexion higher than robert martin  she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom  with probably no settled provision at all  and certainly no respectable relations   she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school   she is not a sensible girl  nor a girl of any information   she has been taught nothing useful  and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself  at her age she can have no experience  and with her little wit  is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her  she is pretty  and she is good tempered  and that is all  my only scruple in advising the match was on his account  as being beneath his deserts  and a bad connexion for him   i felt that  as to fortune  in all probability he might do much better  and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate  he could not do worse  but i could not reason so to a man in love  and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her  to her having that sort of disposition  which  in good hands  like his  might be easily led aright and turn out very well   the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side  and had not the smallest doubt  nor have i now  that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck  even  your  satisfaction i made sure of   it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend  leaving highbury  for the sake of her being settled so well   i remember saying to myself  `even emma  with all her partiality for harriet  will think this a good match '    i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing   what! think a farmer   and with all his sense and all his merit mr  martin is nothing more   a good match for my intimate friend! not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings  i assure you mine are very different   i must think your statement by no means fair   you are not just to harriet  claims  they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself  mr  martin may be the richest of the two  but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society   the sphere in which she moves is much above his   it would be a degradation     a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance  to be married to a respectable  intelligent gentleman farmer!    as to the circumstances of her birth  though in a legal sense she may be called nobody  it will not hold in common sense  she is not to pay for the offence of others  by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up   there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman  and a gentleman of fortune   her allowance is very liberal  nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort   that she is a gentleman  daughter  is indubitable to me  that she associates with gentlemen  daughters  no one  i apprehend  will deny   she is superior to mr  robert martin     whoever might be her parents   said mr  knightley   whoever may have had the charge of her  it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society  after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs  goddard  hands to shift as she can   to move  in short  in mrs  goddard  line  to have mrs  goddard  acquaintance  her friends evidently thought this good enough for her  and it  was  good enough   she desired nothing better herself   till you chose to turn her into a friend  her mind had no distaste for her own set  nor any ambition beyond it   she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer   she had no sense of superiority then  if she has it now  you have given it   you have been no friend to harriet smith  emma   robert martin would never have proceeded so far  if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him  i know him well   he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion   and as to conceit  he is the farthest from it of any man i know   depend upon it he had encouragement    it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again    you are a very warm friend to mr  martin  but  as i said before  are unjust to harriet   harriet  claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them   she is not a clever girl  but she has better sense than you are aware of  and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly  waiving that point  however  and supposing her to be  as you describe her  only pretty and good natured  let me tell you  that in the degree she possesses them  they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general  for she is  in fact  a beautiful girl  and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred  and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed  till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces  a girl  with such loveliness as harriet  has a certainty of being admired and sought after  of having the power of chusing from among many  consequently a claim to be nice   her good nature  too  is not so very slight a claim  comprehending  as it does  real  thorough sweetness of temper and manner  a very humble opinion of herself  and a great readiness to be pleased with other people   i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty  and such temper  the highest claims a woman could possess     upon my word  emma  to hear you abusing the reason you have  is almost enough to make me think so too   better be without sense  than misapply it as you do     to be sure!  cried she playfully    i know  that  is the feeling of you all   i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in  what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment   oh! harriet may pick and chuse  were you  yourself  ever to marry  she is the very woman for you  and is she  at seventeen  just entering into life  just beginning to be known  to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives  no  pray let her have time to look about her     i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy   said mr  knightley presently   though i have kept my thoughts to myself  but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet  you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty  and of what she has a claim to  that  in a little while  nobody within her reach will be good enough for her   vanity working on a weak head  produces every sort of mischief   nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high   miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast  though she is a very pretty girl  men of sense  whatever you may chuse to say  do not want silly wives  men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity  and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in  when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed   let her marry robert martin  and she is safe  respectable  and happy for ever  but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly  and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune  she may be a parlour boarder at mrs  goddard  all the rest of her life  or  at least   for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other   till she grow desperate  and is glad to catch at the old writing master  son     we think so very differently on this point  mr  knightley  that there can be no use in canvassing it   we shall only be making each other more angry   but as to my  letting  her marry robert martin  it is impossible  she has refused him  and so decidedly  i think  as must prevent any second application   she must abide by the evil of having refused him  whatever it may be  and as to the refusal itself  i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little  but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do  his appearance is so much against him  and his manner so bad  that if she ever were disposed to favour him  she is not now  i can imagine  that before she had seen any body superior  she might tolerate him   he was the brother of her friends  and he took pains to please her  and altogether  having seen nobody better  that must have been his great assistant  she might not  while she was at abbey mill  find him disagreeable  but the case is altered now   she knows now what gentlemen are  and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet     nonsense  errant nonsense  as ever was talked!  cried mr  knightley    robert martin  manners have sense  sincerity  and good humour to recommend them  and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand    emma made no answer  and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned  but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone  she did not repent what she had done  she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be  but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general  which made her dislike having it so loudly against her  and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state  was very disagreeable   some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence  with only one attempt on emma  side to talk of the weather  but he made no answer   he was thinking   the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words    robert martin has no great loss  if he can but think so  and i hope it will not be long before he does   your views for harriet are best known to yourself  but as you make no secret of your love of match making  it is fair to suppose that views  and plans  and projects you have   and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man  i think it will be all labour in vain    emma laughed and disclaimed   he continued    depend upon it  elton will not do   elton is a very good sort of man  and a very respectable vicar of highbury  but not at all likely to make an imprudent match   he knows the value of a good income as well as any body   elton may talk sentimentally  but he will act rationally   he is as well acquainted with his own claims  as you can be with harriet   he knows that he is a very handsome young man  and a great favourite wherever he goes  and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments  when there are only men present  i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away  i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with  who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece     i am very much obliged to you   said emma  laughing again   if i had set my heart on mr  elton  marrying harriet  it would have been very kind to open my eyes  but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself   i have done with match making indeed  i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls   i shall leave off while i am well     good morning to you    said he  rising and walking off abruptly  he was very much vexed   he felt the disappointment of the young man  and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it  by the sanction he had given  and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair  was provoking him exceedingly   emma remained in a state of vexation too  but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her   than in his   she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself  so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary  wrong  as mr  knightley  he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her  she was not so materially cast down  however  but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives  harriet  staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy  the possibility of the young man  coming to mrs  goddard  that morning  and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause  gave alarming ideas   the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness  and when harriet appeared  and in very good spirits  and without having any such reason to give for her long absence  she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind  and convinced her  that let mr  knightley think or say what he would  she had done nothing which woman  friendship and woman  feelings would not justify   he had frightened her a little about mr  elton  but when she considered that mr  knightley could not have observed him as she had done  neither with the interest  nor  she must be allowed to tell herself  in spite of mr  knightley  pretensions  with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself  that he had spoken it hastily and in anger  she was able to believe  that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true  than what he knew any thing about   he certainly might have heard mr  elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done  and mr  elton might not be of an imprudent  inconsiderate disposition as to money matters  he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them  but then  mr  knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives   mr  knightley saw no such passion  and of course thought nothing of its effects  but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest  and more than a reasonable  becoming degree of prudence  she was very sure did not belong to mr  elton   harriet  cheerful look and manner established hers  she came back  not to think of mr  martin  but to talk of mr  elton   miss nash had been telling her something  which she repeated immediately with great delight   mr  perry had been to mrs  goddard  to attend a sick child  and miss nash had seen him  and he had told miss nash  that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park  he had met mr  elton  and found to his great surprize  that mr  elton was actually on his road to london  and not meaning to return till the morrow  though it was the whist club night  which he had been never known to miss before  and mr  perry had remonstrated with him about it  and told him how shabby it was in him  their best player  to absent himself  and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day  but it would not do  mr  elton had been determined to go on  and had said in a  very   particular  way indeed  that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world  and something about a very enviable commission  and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious   mr  perry could not quite understand him  but he was very sure there must be a  lady  in the case  and he told him so  and mr  elton only looked very conscious and smiling  and rode off in great spirits  miss nash had told her all this  and had talked a great deal more about mr  elton  and said  looking so very significantly at her   that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be  but she only knew that any woman whom mr  elton could prefer  she should think the luckiest woman in the world  for  beyond a doubt  mr  elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness      chapter ix   mr  knightley might quarrel with her  but emma could not quarrel with herself   he was so much displeased  that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again  and when they did meet  his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven   she was sorry  but could not repent   on the contrary  her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days   the picture  elegantly framed  came safely to hand soon after mr  elton  return  and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting room  he got up to look at it  and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought  and as for harriet  feelings  they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted   emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr  martin  being no otherwise remembered  than as he furnished a contrast with mr  elton  of the utmost advantage to the latter   her views of improving her little friend  mind  by a great deal of useful reading and conversation  had never yet led to more than a few first chapters  and the intention of going on to morrow  it was much easier to chat than to study  much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet  fortune  than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts  and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present  the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life  was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with  into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper  made up by her friend  and ornamented with ciphers and trophies   in this age of literature  such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon   miss nash  head teacher at mrs  goddard   had written out at least three hundred  and harriet  who had taken the first hint of it from her  hoped  with miss woodhouse  help  to get a great many more   emma assisted with her invention  memory and taste  and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand  it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order  in form as well as quantity   mr  woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls  and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in   so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young  he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time   and it always ended in  kitty  a fair but frozen maid    his good friend perry  too  whom he had spoken to on the subject  did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind  but he had desired perry to be upon the watch  and as he went about so much  something  he thought  might come from that quarter   it was by no means his daughter  wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition   mr  elton was the only one whose assistance she asked   he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas  charades  or conundrums that he might recollect  and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections  and at the same time  as she could perceive  most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant  nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips   they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles  and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled  and rather sentimentally recited  that well known charade       my first doth affliction denote        which my second is destin'd to feel     and my whole is the best antidote       that affliction to soften and heal     made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already    why will not you write one yourself for us  mr  elton   said she   that is the only security for its freshness  and nothing could be easier to you     oh no! he had never written  hardly ever  any thing of the kind in his life   the stupidest fellow! he was afraid not even miss woodhouse   he stopt a moment   or miss smith could inspire him    the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration  he called for a few moments  just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing  as he said  a charade  which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady  the object of his admiration  but which  from his manner  emma was immediately convinced must be his own    i do not offer it for miss smith  collection   said he   being my friend   i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye  but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it    the speech was more to emma than to harriet  which emma could understand   there was deep consciousness about him  and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend   he was gone the next moment   after another moment  pause    take it   said emma  smiling  and pushing the paper towards harriet   it is for you   take your own    but harriet was in a tremor  and could not touch it  and emma  never loth to be first  was obliged to examine it herself           to miss              charade       my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings        lords of the earth! their luxury and ease      another view of man  my second brings        behold him there  the monarch of the seas!      but ah! united  what reverse we have!       man  boasted power and freedom  all are flown      lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave        and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone         thy ready wit the word will soon supply        may its approval beam in that soft eye!  she cast her eye over it  pondered  caught the meaning  read it through again to be quite certain  and quite mistress of the lines  and then passing it to harriet  sat happily smiling  and saying to herself  while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness   very well  mr  elton  very well indeed  i have read worse charades    courtship   a very good hint   i give you credit for it   this is feeling your way   this is saying very plainly  `pray  miss smith  give me leave to pay my addresses to you  approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance '        may its approval beam in that soft eye!  harriet exactly   soft is the very word for her eye  of all epithets  the justest that could be given         thy ready wit the word will soon supply   humph  harriet  ready wit! all the better   a man must be very much in love  indeed  to describe her so   ah! mr  knightley  i wish you had the benefit of this  i think this would convince you  for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken  an excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose  things must come to a crisis soon now   she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations  which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length  by the eagerness of harriet  wondering questions    what can it be  miss woodhouse   what can it be  i have not an idea  i cannot guess it in the least   what can it possibly be  do try to find it out  miss woodhouse   do help me   i never saw any thing so hard   is it kingdom  i wonder who the friend was  and who could be the young lady   do you think it is a good one  can it be woman         and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone   can it be neptune         behold him there  the monarch of the seas!  or a trident  or a mermaid  or a shark  oh  no! shark is only one syllable   it must be very clever  or he would not have brought it  oh! miss woodhouse  do you think we shall ever find it out     mermaids and sharks! nonsense! my dear harriet  what are you thinking of  where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark  give me the paper and listen   for miss             read miss smith       my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings        lords of the earth! their luxury and ease   that is  court        another view of man  my second brings        behold him there  the monarch of the seas!  that is  ship    plain as it can be   now for the cream       but ah! united    courtship   you know   what reverse we have!       man  boasted power and freedom  all are flown      lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave        and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone   a very proper compliment!  and then follows the application  which i think  my dear harriet  you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending   read it in comfort to yourself   there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you    harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion  she read the concluding lines  and was all flutter and happiness  she could not speak   but she was not wanted to speak   it was enough for her to feel   emma spoke for her    there is so pointed  and so particular a meaning in this compliment   said she   that i cannot have a doubt as to mr  elton  intentions  you are his object  and you will soon receive the completest proof of it   i thought it must be so   i thought i could not be so deceived  but now  it is clear  the state of his mind is as clear and decided  as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you  yes  harriet  just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened   i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr  elton were most desirable or most natural  its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! i am very happy   i congratulate you  my dear harriet  with all my heart   this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating   this is a connexion which offers nothing but good  it will give you every thing that you want  consideration  independence  a proper home  it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends  close to hartfield and to me  and confirm our intimacy for ever  this  harriet  is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us     dear miss woodhouse!   and  dear miss woodhouse   was all that harriet  with many tender embraces could articulate at first  but when they did arrive at something more like conversation  it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw  felt  anticipated  and remembered just as she ought   mr  elton  superiority had very ample acknowledgment    whatever you say is always right   cried harriet   and therefore i suppose  and believe  and hope it must be so  but otherwise i could not have imagined it   it is so much beyond any thing i deserve  mr  elton  who might marry any body! there cannot be two opinions about  him    he is so very superior   only think of those sweet verses  `to miss          ' dear me  how clever!  could it really be meant for me     i cannot make a question  or listen to a question about that  it is a certainty   receive it on my judgment   it is a sort of prologue to the play  a motto to the chapter  and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose     it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected   i am sure  a month ago  i had no more idea myself!  the strangest things do take place!    when miss smiths and mr  eltons get acquainted  they do indeed  and really it is strange  it is out of the common course that what is so evidently  so palpably desirable  what courts the pre arrangement of other people  should so immediately shape itself into the proper form  you and mr  elton are by situation called together  you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes  your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls   there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction  and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow         the course of true love never did run smooth    a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage     that mr  elton should really be in love with me   me  of all people  who did not know him  to speak to him  at michaelmas! and he  the very handsomest man that ever was  and a man that every body looks up to  quite like mr  knightley! his company so sought after  that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it  that he has more invitations than there are days in the week   and so excellent in the church! miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury  dear me! when i look back to the first time i saw him! how little did i think!  the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by  and miss nash came and scolded us away  and staid to look through herself  however  she called me back presently  and let me look too  which was very good natured  and how beautiful we thought he looked! he was arm in arm with mr  cole     this is an alliance which  whoever  whatever your friends may be  must be agreeable to them  provided at least they have common sense  and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools   if they are anxious to see you  happily  married  here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it   if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in  here it will be accomplished  and if their only object is that you should  in the common phrase  be  well  married  here is the comfortable fortune  the respectable establishment  the rise in the world which must satisfy them     yes  very true   how nicely you talk  i love to hear you  you understand every thing   you and mr  elton are one as clever as the other   this charade!  if i had studied a twelvemonth  i could never have made any thing like it     i thought he meant to try his skill  by his manner of declining it yesterday     i do think it is  without exception  the best charade i ever read     i never read one more to the purpose  certainly     it is as long again as almost all we have had before     i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour  such things in general cannot be too short    harriet was too intent on the lines to hear   the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind    it is one thing   said she  presently  her cheeks in a glow   to have very good sense in a common way  like every body else  and if there is any thing to say  to sit down and write a letter  and say just what you must  in a short way  and another  to write verses and charades like this    emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr  martin  prose    such sweet lines!  continued harriet   these two last!  but how shall i ever be able to return the paper  or say i have found it out   oh! miss woodhouse  what can we do about that     leave it to me   you do nothing   he will be here this evening  i dare say  and then i will give it him back  and some nonsense or other will pass between us  and you shall not be committed   your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming   trust to me     oh! miss woodhouse  what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book! i am sure i have not got one half so good     leave out the two last lines  and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book     oh! but those two lines are        the best of all   granted   for private enjoyment  and for private enjoyment keep them   they are not at all the less written you know  because you divide them   the couplet does not cease to be  nor does its meaning change   but take it away  and all  appropriation  ceases  and a very pretty gallant charade remains  fit for any collection  depend upon it  he would not like to have his charade slighted  much better than his passion   a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities  or neither   give me the book  i will write it down  and then there can be no possible reflection on you    harriet submitted  though her mind could hardly separate the parts  so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love   it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity    i shall never let that book go out of my own hands   said she    very well   replied emma   a most natural feeling  and the longer it lasts  the better i shall be pleased   but here is my father coming  you will not object to my reading the charade to him  it will be giving him so much pleasure! he loves any thing of the sort  and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment  he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!  you must let me read it to him    harriet looked grave    my dear harriet  you must not refine too much upon this charade   you will betray your feelings improperly  if you are too conscious and too quick  and appear to affix more meaning  or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it  do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration  if he had been anxious for secrecy  he would not have left the paper while i was by  but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you  do not let us be too solemn on the business   he has encouragement enough to proceed  without our sighing out our souls over this charade     oh! no  i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it   do as you please    mr  woodhouse came in  and very soon led to the subject again  by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of  well  my dears  how does your book go on   have you got any thing fresh     yes  papa  we have something to read you  something quite fresh  a piece of paper was found on the table this morning   dropt  we suppose  by a fairy   containing a very pretty charade  and we have just copied it in    she read it to him  just as he liked to have any thing read  slowly and distinctly  and two or three times over  with explanations of every part as she proceeded  and he was very much pleased  and  as she had foreseen  especially struck with the complimentary conclusion    aye  that  very just  indeed  that  very properly said  very true   `woman  lovely woman ' it is such a pretty charade  my dear  that i can easily guess what fairy brought it   nobody could have written so prettily  but you  emma    emma only nodded  and smiled   after a little thinking  and a very tender sigh  he added    ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! your dear mother was so clever at all those things! if i had but her memory! but i can remember nothing   not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention  i can only recollect the first stanza  and there are several       kitty  a fair but frozen maid        kindled a flame i yet deplore      the hood wink'd boy i called to aid      though of his near approach afraid        so fatal to my suit before   and that is all that i can recollect of it  but it is very clever all the way through   but i think  my dear  you said you had got it     yes  papa  it is written out in our second page   we copied it from the elegant extracts   it was garrick   you know     aye  very true   i wish i could recollect more of it       kitty  a fair but frozen maid   the name makes me think of poor isabella  for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama   i hope we shall have her here next week   have you thought  my dear  where you shall put her  and what room there will be for the children     oh! yes  she will have her own room  of course  the room she always has   and there is the nursery for the children   just as usual  you know   why should there be any change     i do not know  my dear  but it is so long since she was here!  not since last easter  and then only for a few days   mr  john knightley  being a lawyer is very inconvenient   poor isabella!  she is sadly taken away from us all!  and how sorry she will be when she comes  not to see miss taylor here!    she will not be surprized  papa  at least     i do not know  my dear   i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married     we must ask mr  and mrs  weston to dine with us  while isabella is here     yes  my dear  if there is time   but   in a very depressed tone   she is coming for only one week   there will not be time for any thing     it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer  but it seems a case of necessity   mr  john knightley must be in town again on the 28th  and we ought to be thankful  papa  that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country  that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey   mr  knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas  though you know it is longer since they were with him  than with us     it would be very hard  indeed  my dear  if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield    mr  woodhouse could never allow for mr  knightley  claims on his brother  or any body  claims on isabella  except his own  he sat musing a little while  and then said    but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon  though he does   i think  emma  i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us   she and the children might stay very well     ah! papa  that is what you never have been able to accomplish  and i do not think you ever will   isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband    this was too true for contradiction   unwelcome as it was  mr  woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh  and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter  attachment to her husband  she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them    harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here   i am sure she will be pleased with the children   we are very proud of the children  are not we  papa  i wonder which she will think the handsomest  henry or john     aye  i wonder which she will   poor little dears  how glad they will be to come   they are very fond of being at hartfield  harriet     i dare say they are  sir   i am sure i do not know who is not     henry is a fine boy  but john is very like his mama   henry is the eldest  he was named after me  not after his father   john  the second  is named after his father   some people are surprized  i believe  that the eldest was not  but isabella would have him called henry  which i thought very pretty of her   and he is a very clever boy  indeed   they are all remarkably clever  and they have so many pretty ways   they will come and stand by my chair  and say  `grandpapa  can you give me a bit of string ' and once henry asked me for a knife  but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas  i think their father is too rough with them very often     he appears rough to you   said emma   because you are so very gentle yourself  but if you could compare him with other papas  you would not think him rough   he wishes his boys to be active and hardy  and if they misbehave  can give them a sharp word now and then  but he is an affectionate father  certainly mr  john knightley is an affectionate father   the children are all fond of him     and then their uncle comes in  and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!    but they like it  papa  there is nothing they like so much  it is such enjoyment to them  that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns  whichever began would never give way to the other     well  i cannot understand it     that is the case with us all  papa   one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other    later in the morning  and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner  the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again   harriet turned away  but emma could receive him with the usual smile  and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push  of having thrown a die  and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up   his ostensible reason  however  was to ask whether mr  woodhouse  party could be made up in the evening without him  or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield  if he were  every thing else must give way  but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him  had made such a point of it  that he had promised him conditionally to come   emma thanked him  but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account  her father was sure of his rubber  he re urged  she re declined  and he seemed then about to make his bow  when taking the paper from the table  she returned it     oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us  thank you for the sight of it   we admired it so much  that i have ventured to write it into miss smith  collection   your friend will not take it amiss i hope   of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines    mr  elton certainly did not very well know what to say  he looked rather doubtingly  rather confused  said something about  honour    glanced at emma and at harriet  and then seeing the book open on the table  took it up  and examined it very attentively  with the view of passing off an awkward moment  emma smilingly said    you must make my apologies to your friend  but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two   he may be sure of every woman  approbation while he writes with such gallantry     i have no hesitation in saying   replied mr  elton  though hesitating a good deal while he spoke   i have no hesitation in saying  at least if my friend feels at all as  i  do  i have not the smallest doubt that  could he see his little effusion honoured as  i  see it   looking at the book again  and replacing it on the table   he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life    after this speech he was gone as soon as possible   emma could not think it too soon  for with all his good and agreeable qualities  there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh   she ran away to indulge the inclination  leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet  share     chapter x   though now the middle of december  there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise  and on the morrow  emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family  who lived a little way out of highbury   their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane  a lane leading at right angles from the broad  though irregular  main street of the place  and  as may be inferred  containing the blessed abode of mr  elton   a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed  and then  about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage  an old and not very good house  almost as close to the road as it could be   it had no advantage of situation  but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor  and  such as it was  there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes   emma  remark was     there it is   there go you and your riddle book one of these days     harriet  was     oh  what a sweet house!  how very beautiful!  there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much     i do not often walk this way  now    said emma  as they proceeded   but  then  there will be an inducement  and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges  gates  pools and pollards of this part of highbury    harriet  she found  had never in her life been within side the vicarage  and her curiosity to see it was so extreme  that  considering exteriors and probabilities  emma could only class it  as a proof of love  with mr  elton  seeing ready wit in her    i wish we could contrive it   said she   but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in   no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper  no message from my father    she pondered  but could think of nothing   after a mutual silence of some minutes  harriet thus began again     i do so wonder  miss woodhouse  that you should not be married  or going to be married! so charming as you are!     emma laughed  and replied    my being charming  harriet  is not quite enough to induce me to marry  i must find other people charming  one other person at least  and i am not only  not going to be married  at present  but have very little intention of ever marrying at all     ah!  so you say  but i cannot believe it     i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet  to be tempted  mr  elton  you know   recollecting herself   is out of the question   and i do  not  wish to see any such person  i would rather not be tempted   i cannot really change for the better  if i were to marry  i must expect to repent it     dear me!  it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!      i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry  were i to fall in love  indeed  it would be a different thing! but i never have been in love  it is not my way  or my nature  and i do not think i ever shall   and  without love  i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine   fortune i do not want  employment i do not want  consequence i do not want  i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband  house as i am of hartfield  and never  never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important  so always first and always right in any man  eyes as i am in my father      but then  to be an old maid at last  like miss bates!    that is as formidable an image as you could present  harriet  and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates! so silly  so satisfied   so smiling  so prosing  so undistinguishing and unfastidious   and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me  i would marry to morrow  but between  us   i am convinced there never can be any likeness  except in being unmarried     but still  you will be an old maid! and that  so dreadful!    never mind  harriet  i shall not be a poor old maid  and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! a single woman  with a very narrow income  must be a ridiculous  disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls  but a single woman  of good fortune  is always respectable  and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else   and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first  for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind  and sour the temper  those who can barely live  and who live perforce in a very small  and generally very inferior  society  may well be illiberal and cross  this does not apply  however  to miss bates  she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me  but  in general  she is very much to the taste of every body  though single and though poor  poverty certainly has not contracted her mind   i really believe  if she had only a shilling in the world  she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it  and nobody is afraid of her   that is a great charm     dear me! but what shall you do  how shall you employ yourself when you grow old     if i know myself  harriet  mine is an active  busy mind  with a great many independent resources  and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty  woman  usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now  or with no important variation   if i draw less  i shall read more  if i give up music  i shall take to carpet work  and as for objects of interest  objects for the affections  which is in truth the great point of inferiority  the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in  not  marrying  i shall be very well off  with all the children of a sister i love so much  to care about   there will be enough of them  in all probability  to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need  there will be enough for every hope and every fear  and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent  it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder   my nephews and nieces!  i shall often have a niece with me     do you know miss bates  niece   that is  i know you must have seen her a hundred times  but are you acquainted     oh! yes  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury   by the bye   that  is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece   heaven forbid! at least  that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together  as she does about jane fairfax   one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax   every letter from her is read forty times over  her compliments to all friends go round and round again  and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher  or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother  one hears of nothing else for a month  i wish jane fairfax very well  but she tires me to death    they were now approaching the cottage  and all idle topics were superseded   emma was very compassionate  and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness  her counsel and her patience  as from her purse  she understood their ways  could allow for their ignorance and their temptations  had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little  entered into their troubles with ready sympathy  and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good will   in the present instance  it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit  and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice  she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet  as they walked away    these are the sights  harriet  to do one good   how trifling they make every thing else appear!  i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day  and yet  who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind     very true   said harriet    poor creatures! one can think of nothing else     and really  i do not think the impression will soon be over   said emma  as she crossed the low hedge  and tottering footstep which ended the narrow  slippery path through the cottage garden  and brought them into the lane again    i do not think it will   stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place  and recall the still greater within    oh! dear  no   said her companion   they walked on   the lane made a slight bend  and when that bend was passed  mr  elton was immediately in sight  and so near as to give emma time only to say farther    ah!  harriet  here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts   well   smiling   i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers  it has done all that is truly important   if we feel for the wretched  enough to do all we can for them  the rest is empty sympathy  only distressing to ourselves    harriet could just answer   oh! dear  yes   before the gentleman joined them   the wants and sufferings of the poor family  however  were the first subject on meeting   he had been going to call on them   his visit he would now defer  but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done  mr  elton then turned back to accompany them    to fall in with each other on such an errand as this   thought emma   to meet in a charitable scheme  this will bring a great increase of love on each side   i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration   it must  if i were not here   i wish i were anywhere else    anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could  she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath  a little raised on one side of the lane  leaving them together in the main road  but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet  habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too  and that  in short  they would both be soon after her   this would not do  she immediately stopped  under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half boot  and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath  begged them to have the goodness to walk on  and she would follow in half a minute   they did as they were desired  and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot  she had the comfort of farther delay in her power  being overtaken by a child from the cottage  setting out  according to orders  with her pitcher  to fetch broth from hartfield   to walk by the side of this child  and talk to and question her  was the most natural thing in the world  or would have been the most natural  had she been acting just then without design  and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead  without any obligation of waiting for her  she gained on them  however  involuntarily   the child  pace was quick  and theirs rather slow  and she was the more concerned at it  from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them  mr  elton was speaking with animation  harriet listening with a very pleased attention  and emma  having sent the child on  was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more  when they both looked around  and she was obliged to join them   mr  elton was still talking  still engaged in some interesting detail  and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday  party at his friend cole   and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese  the north wiltshire  the butter  the cellery  the beet root  and all the dessert    this would soon have led to something better  of course   was her consoling reflection   any thing interests between those who love  and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart  if i could but have kept longer away!   they now walked on together quietly  till within view of the vicarage pales  when a sudden resolution  of at least getting harriet into the house  made her again find something very much amiss about her boot  and fall behind to arrange it once more   she then broke the lace off short  and dexterously throwing it into a ditch  was presently obliged to entreat them to stop  and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort    part of my lace is gone   said she   and i do not know how i am to contrive   i really am a most troublesome companion to you both  but i hope i am not often so ill equipped  mr  elton  i must beg leave to stop at your house  and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string  or any thing just to keep my boot on    mr  elton looked all happiness at this proposition  and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage  the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied  and looking forwards  behind it was another with which it immediately communicated  the door between them was open  and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner   she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it  but she fully intended that mr  elton should close it  it was not closed  however  it still remained ajar  but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation  she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room  for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself   it could be protracted no longer   she was then obliged to be finished  and make her appearance   the lovers were standing together at one of the windows   it had a most favourable aspect  and  for half a minute  emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully   but it would not do  he had not come to the point   he had been most agreeable  most delightful  he had told harriet that he had seen them go by  and had purposely followed them  other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt  but nothing serious    cautious  very cautious   thought emma   he advances inch by inch  and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure    still  however  though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device  she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both  and must be leading them forward to the great event     chapter xi   mr  elton must now be left to himself   it was no longer in emma  power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures  the coming of her sister  family was so very near at hand  that first in anticipation  and then in reality  it became henceforth her prime object of interest  and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected  she did not herself expect   that any thing beyond occasional  fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers   they might advance rapidly if they would  however  they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no   she hardly wished to have more leisure for them  there are people  who the more you do for them  the less they will do for themselves   mr  and mrs  john knightley  from having been longer than usual absent from surry  were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest   till this year  every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey  but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing for the children  and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions  or seen at all by mr  woodhouse  who could not be induced to get so far as london  even for poor isabella  sake  and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit   he thought much of the evils of the journey for her  and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way  but his alarms were needless  the sixteen miles being happily accomplished  and mr  and mrs  john knightley  their five children  and a competent number of nursery maids  all reaching hartfield in safety  the bustle and joy of such an arrival  the many to be talked to  welcomed  encouraged  and variously dispersed and disposed of  produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause  nor have endured much longer even for this  but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs  john knightley  that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones  and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance  all the eating and drinking  and sleeping and playing  which they could possibly wish for  without the smallest delay  the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him  either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them   mrs  john knightley was a pretty  elegant little woman  of gentle  quiet manners  and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate  wrapt up in her family  a devoted wife  a doating mother  and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that  but for these higher ties  a warmer love might have seemed impossible  she could never see a fault in any of them   she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness  and with this resemblance of her father  she inherited also much of his constitution  was delicate in her own health  over careful of that of her children  had many fears and many nerves  and was as fond of her own mr  wingfield in town as her father could be of mr  perry   they were alike too  in a general benevolence of temper  and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance   mr  john knightley was a tall  gentleman like  and very clever man  rising in his profession  domestic  and respectable in his private character  but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing  and capable of being sometimes out of humour  he was not an ill tempered man  not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach  but his temper was not his great perfection  and  indeed  with such a worshipping wife  it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased   the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his  he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted  and he could sometimes act an ungracious  or say a severe thing   he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law  nothing wrong in him escaped her   she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella  which isabella never felt herself  perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella  sister  but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend  without praise and without blindness  but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into  the want of respectful forbearance towards her father  there he had not always the patience that could have been wished  mr  woodhouse  peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed  it did not often happen  for mr  john knightley had really a great regard for his father in law  and generally a strong sense of what was due to him  but it was too often for emma  charity  especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured  though the offence came not   the beginning  however  of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings  and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality  they had not been long seated and composed when mr  woodhouse  with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh  called his daughter  attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last    ah  my dear   said he   poor miss taylor  it is a grievous business     oh yes  sir   cried she with ready sympathy   how you must miss her!  and dear emma  too!  what a dreadful loss to you both!   i have been so grieved for you   i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her   it is a sad change indeed   but i hope she is pretty well  sir     pretty well  my dear  i hope  pretty well   i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably    mr  john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls    oh! no  none in the least   i never saw mrs  weston better in my life   never looking so well   papa is only speaking his own regret     very much to the honour of both   was the handsome reply    and do you see her  sir  tolerably often   asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father   mr  woodhouse hesitated    not near so often  my dear  as i could wish     oh! papa  we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married   either in the morning or evening of every day  excepting one  have we seen either mr  weston or mrs  weston  and generally both  either at randalls or here  and as you may suppose  isabella  most frequently here   they are very  very kind in their visits   mr  weston is really as kind as herself  papa  if you speak in that melancholy way  you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all   every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed  but every body ought also to be assured that mr  and mrs  weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated  which is the exact truth     just as it should be   said mr  john knightley   and just as i hoped it was from your letters   her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted  and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy   i have been always telling you  my love  that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended  and now you have emma  account  i hope you will be satisfied     why  to be sure   said mr  woodhouse   yes  certainly  i cannot deny that mrs  weston  poor mrs  weston  does come and see us pretty often   but then  she is always obliged to go away again     it would be very hard upon mr  weston if she did not  papa    you quite forget poor mr  weston     i think  indeed   said john knightley pleasantly   that mr  weston has some little claim   you and i  emma  will venture to take the part of the poor husband   i  being a husband  and you not being a wife  the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force  as for isabella  she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr  westons aside as much as she can     me  my love   cried his wife  hearing and understanding only in part     are you talking about me   i am sure nobody ought to be  or can be  a greater advocate for matrimony than i am  and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield  i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world  and as to slighting mr  weston  that excellent mr  weston  i think there is nothing he does not deserve   i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed   excepting yourself and your brother  i do not know his equal for temper   i shall never forget his flying henry  kite for him that very windy day last easter  and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note  at twelve o'clock at night  on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham  i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence   if any body can deserve him  it must be miss taylor     where is the young man   said john knightley    has he been here on this occasion  or has he not     he has not been here yet   replied emma    there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage  but it ended in nothing  and i have not heard him mentioned lately     but you should tell them of the letter  my dear   said her father   he wrote a letter to poor mrs  weston  to congratulate her  and a very proper  handsome letter it was   she shewed it to me  i thought it very well done of him indeed   whether it was his own idea you know  one cannot tell   he is but young  and his uncle  perhaps      my dear papa  he is three and twenty  you forget how time passes     three and twenty!  is he indeed   well  i could not have thought it   and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  well  time does fly indeed!  and my memory is very bad   however  it was an exceeding good  pretty letter  and gave mr  and mrs  weston a great deal of pleasure   i remember it was written from weymouth  and dated sept  28th  and began  `my dear madam ' but i forget how it went on  and it was signed `f  c  weston churchill '   i remember that perfectly     how very pleasing and proper of him!  cried the good hearted mrs  john knightley    i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man  but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! there is something so shocking in a child  being taken away from his parents and natural home!  i never could comprehend how mr  weston could part with him   to give up one  child!  i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else     nobody ever did think well of the churchills  i fancy   observed mr  john knightley coolly    but you need not imagine mr  weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john   mr  weston is rather an easy  cheerful tempered man  than a man of strong feelings  he takes things as he finds them  and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other  depending  i suspect  much more upon what is called society for his comforts  that is  upon the power of eating and drinking  and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week  than upon family affection  or any thing that home affords    emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr  weston  and had half a mind to take it up  but she struggled  and let it pass   she would keep the peace if possible  and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits  the all sufficiency of home to himself  whence resulted her brother  disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse  and those to whom it was important   it had a high claim to forbearance     chapter xii   mr  knightley was to dine with them  rather against the inclination of mr  woodhouse  who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella  first day   emma  sense of right however had decided it  and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother  she had particular pleasure  from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr  knightley and herself  in procuring him the proper invitation   she hoped they might now become friends again   she thought it was time to make up   making up indeed would not do    she  certainly had not been in the wrong  and  he  would never own that he had  concession must be out of the question  but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled  and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship  that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her  the youngest  a nice little girl about eight months old  who was now making her first visit to hartfield  and very happy to be danced about in her aunt  arms   it did assist  for though he began with grave looks and short questions  he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way  and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity  emma felt they were friends again  and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction  and then a little sauciness  she could not help saying  as he was admiring the baby    what a comfort it is  that we think alike about our nephews and nieces  as to men and women  our opinions are sometimes very different  but with regard to these children  i observe we never disagree     if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women  and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them  as you are where these children are concerned  we might always think alike     to be sure  our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong     yes   said he  smiling   and reason good   i was sixteen years old when you were born     a material difference then   she replied   and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives  but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer     yes  a good deal  nearer      but still  not near enough to give me a chance of being right  if we think differently     i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience  and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child   come  my dear emma  let us be friends  and say no more about it   tell your aunt  little emma  that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances  and that if she were not wrong before  she is now     that  true   she cried   very true   little emma  grow up a better woman than your aunt   be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited   now  mr  knightley  a word or two more  and i have done   as far as good intentions went  we were  both  right  and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong   i only want to know that mr  martin is not very  very bitterly disappointed     a man cannot be more so   was his short  full answer    ah!  indeed i am very sorry   come  shake hands with me    this had just taken place and with great cordiality  when john knightley made his appearance  and  how d'ye do  george   and  john  how are you   succeeded in the true english style  burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference  the real attachment which would have led either of them  if requisite  to do every thing for the good of the other   the evening was quiet and conversable  as mr  woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella  and the little party made two natural divisions  on one side he and his daughter  on the other the two mr  knightleys  their subjects totally distinct  or very rarely mixing  and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other   the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits  but principally of those of the elder  whose temper was by much the most communicative  and who was always the greater talker   as a magistrate  he had generally some point of law to consult john about  or  at least  some curious anecdote to give  and as a farmer  as keeping in hand the home farm at donwell  he had to tell what every field was to bear next year  and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life  and whose attachments were strong  the plan of a drain  the change of a fence  the felling of a tree  and the destination of every acre for wheat  turnips  or spring corn  was entered into with as much equality of interest by john  as his cooler manners rendered possible  and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about  his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness   while they were thus comfortably occupied  mr  woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter    my poor dear isabella   said he  fondly taking her hand  and interrupting  for a few moments  her busy labours for some one of her five children   how long it is  how terribly long since you were here!  and how tired you must be after your journey!  you must go to bed early  my dear  and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go   you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together  my dear emma  suppose we all have a little gruel    emma could not suppose any such thing  knowing as she did  that both the mr  knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself   and two basins only were ordered   after a little more discourse in praise of gruel  with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body  he proceeded to say  with an air of grave reflection    it was an awkward business  my dear  your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here   i never had much opinion of the sea air     mr  wingfield most strenuously recommended it  sir  or we should not have gone   he recommended it for all the children  but particularly for the weakness in little bella  throat    both sea air and bathing     ah! my dear  but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good  and as to myself  i have been long perfectly convinced  though perhaps i never told you so before  that the sea is very rarely of use to any body   i am sure it almost killed me once     come  come   cried emma  feeling this to be an unsafe subject   i must beg you not to talk of the sea   it makes me envious and miserable    i who have never seen it!  south end is prohibited  if you please  my dear isabella  i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr  perry yet  and he never forgets you     oh! good mr  perry  how is he  sir     why  pretty well  but not quite well   poor perry is bilious  and he has not time to take care of himself  he tells me he has not time to take care of himself  which is very sad  but he is always wanted all round the country   i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere   but then there is not so clever a man any where     and mrs  perry and the children  how are they  do the children grow  i have a great regard for mr  perry   i hope he will be calling soon  he will be so pleased to see my little ones     i hope he will be here to morrow  for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence   and  my dear  whenever he comes  you had better let him look at little bella  throat     oh! my dear sir  her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it   either bathing has been of the greatest service to her  or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr  wingfield   which we have been applying at times ever since august     it is not very likely  my dear  that bathing should have been of use to her  and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation  i would have spoken to     you seem to me to have forgotten mrs  and miss bates   said emma   i have not heard one inquiry after them     oh! the good bateses  i am quite ashamed of myself  but you mention them in most of your letters   i hope they are quite well  good old mrs  bates  i will call upon her to morrow  and take my children   they are always so pleased to see my children    and that excellent miss bates!  such thorough worthy people!   how are they  sir     why  pretty well  my dear  upon the whole   but poor mrs  bates had a bad cold about a month ago     how sorry i am!  but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn   mr  wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy  except when it has been quite an influenza     that has been a good deal the case  my dear  but not to the degree you mention   perry says that colds have been very general  but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november  perry does not call it altogether a sickly season     no  i do not know that mr  wingfield considers it  very  sickly except     ah! my poor dear child  the truth is  that in london it is always a sickly season   nobody is healthy in london  nobody can be  it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!   and the air so bad!    no  indeed   we  are not at all in a bad air   our part of london is very superior to most others!  you must not confound us with london in general  my dear sir   the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest   we are so very airy! i should be unwilling  i own  to live in any other part of the town    there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in   but  we  are so remarkably airy!  mr  wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air     ah! my dear  it is not like hartfield   you make the best of it   but after you have been a week at hartfield  you are all of you different creatures  you do not look like the same   now i cannot say  that i think you are any of you looking well at present     i am sorry to hear you say so  sir  but i assure you  excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere  i am quite well myself  and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed  it was only because they were a little more tired than usual  from their journey and the happiness of coming   i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow  for i assure you mr  wingfield told me  that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether  in such good case   i trust  at least  that you do not think mr  knightley looking ill   turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband    middling  my dear  i cannot compliment you   i think mr  john knightley very far from looking well     what is the matter  sir   did you speak to me   cried mr  john knightley  hearing his own name    i am sorry to find  my love  that my father does not think you looking well  but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued  i could have wished  however  as you know  that you had seen mr  wingfield before you left home     my dear isabella    exclaimed he hastily   pray do not concern yourself about my looks   be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children  and let me look as i chuse     i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother   cried emma   about your friend mr  graham  intending to have a bailiff from scotland  to look after his new estate   what will it answer  will not the old prejudice be too strong    and she talked in this way so long and successfully that  when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister  she had nothing worse to hear than isabella  kind inquiry after jane fairfax  and jane fairfax  though no great favourite with her in general  she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising    that sweet  amiable jane fairfax!  said mrs  john knightley     it is so long since i have seen her  except now and then for a moment accidentally in town!  what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt  when she comes to visit them! i always regret excessively on dear emma  account that she cannot be more at highbury  but now their daughter is married  i suppose colonel and mrs  campbell will not be able to part with her at all  she would be such a delightful companion for emma    mr  woodhouse agreed to it all  but added    our little friend harriet smith  however  is just such another pretty kind of young person   you will like harriet   emma could not have a better companion than harriet     i am most happy to hear it  but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!  and exactly emma  age    this topic was discussed very happily  and others succeeded of similar moment  and passed away with similar harmony  but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation   the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said  much praise and many comments   undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution  and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable   but  unfortunately  among the failures which the daughter had to instance  the most recent  and therefore most prominent  was in her own cook at south end  a young woman hired for the time  who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel  thin  but not too thin  often as she had wished for and ordered it  she had never been able to get any thing tolerable   here was a dangerous opening    ah!  said mr  woodhouse  shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern   the ejaculation in emma  ear expressed   ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end   it does not bear talking of    and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it  and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel  after an interval of some minutes  however  he began with    i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn  instead of coming here     but why should you be sorry  sir   i assure you  it did the children a great deal of good     and  moreover  if you must go to the sea  it had better not have been to south end   south end is an unhealthy place  perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end     i know there is such an idea with many people  but indeed it is quite a mistake  sir   we all had our health perfectly well there  never found the least inconvenience from the mud  and mr  wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy  and i am sure he may be depended on  for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air  and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly     you should have gone to cromer  my dear  if you went anywhere    perry was a week at cromer once  and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places   a fine open sea  he says  and very pure air   and  by what i understand  you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea  a quarter of a mile off  very comfortable  you should have consulted perry     but  my dear sir  the difference of the journey   only consider how great it would have been   an hundred miles  perhaps  instead of forty     ah! my dear  as perry says  where health is at stake  nothing else should be considered  and if one is to travel  there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred   better not move at all  better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air   this is just what perry said   it seemed to him a very ill judged measure    emma  attempts to stop her father had been vain  and when he had reached such a point as this  she could not wonder at her brother in law  breaking out    mr  perry   said he  in a voice of very strong displeasure   would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for  why does he make it any business of his  to wonder at what i do    at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another   i may be allowed  i hope  the use of my judgment as well as mr  perry    i want his directions no more than his drugs    he paused   and growing cooler in a moment  added  with only sarcastic dryness   if mr  perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty  i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself     true  true   cried mr  knightley  with most ready interposition    very true   that  a consideration indeed   but john  as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham  of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows  i cannot conceive any difficulty   i should not attempt it  if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people  but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path        the only way of proving it  however  will be to turn to our maps  i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope  and then we will look them over  and you shall give me your opinion    mr  woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry  to whom he had  in fact  though unconsciously  been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions    but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil  and the immediate alertness of one brother  and better recollections of the other  prevented any renewal of it     chapter xiii   there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs  john knightley  in this short visit to hartfield  going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children  and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister  she had nothing to wish otherwise  but that the days did not pass so swiftly   it was a delightful visit   perfect  in being much too short   in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings  but one complete dinner engagement  and out of the house too  there was no avoiding  though at christmas  mr  weston would take no denial  they must all dine at randalls one day   even mr  woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party   how they were all to be conveyed  he would have made a difficulty if he could  but as his son and daughter  carriage and horses were actually at hartfield  he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head  it hardly amounted to a doubt  nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also   harriet  mr  elton  and mr  knightley  their own especial set  were the only persons invited to meet them   the hours were to be early  as well as the numbers few  mr  woodhouse  habits and inclination being consulted in every thing   the evening before this great event  for it was a very great event that mr  woodhouse should dine out  on the 24th of december  had been spent by harriet at hartfield  and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold  that  but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs  goddard  emma could not have allowed her to leave the house  emma called on her the next day  and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls   she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat   mrs  goddard was full of care and affection  mr  perry was talked of  and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement  though she could not speak of her loss without many tears   emma sat with her as long as she could  to attend her in mrs  goddard  unavoidable absences  and raise her spirits by representing how much mr  elton  would be depressed when he knew her state  and left her at last tolerably comfortable  in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit  and of their all missing her very much  she had not advanced many yards from mrs  goddard  door  when she was met by mr  elton himself  evidently coming towards it  and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid   of whom he  on the rumour of considerable illness  had been going to inquire  that he might carry some report of her to hartfield   they were overtaken by mr  john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell  with his two eldest boys  whose healthy  glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run  and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for   they joined company and proceeded together  emma was just describing the nature of her friend  complaint     a throat very much inflamed  with a great deal of heat about her  a quick  low pulse  &c   and she was sorry to find from mrs  goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats  and had often alarmed her with them    mr  elton looked all alarm on the occasion  as he exclaimed    a sore throat!  i hope not infectious   i hope not of a putrid infectious sort   has perry seen her   indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend   let me entreat you to run no risks   why does not perry see her    emma  who was not really at all frightened herself  tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs  goddard  experience and care  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away  which she would rather feed and assist than not  she added soon afterwards  as if quite another subject    it is so cold  so very cold  and looks and feels so very much like snow  that if it were to any other place or with any other party  i should really try not to go out to day  and dissuade my father from venturing  but as he has made up his mind  and does not seem to feel the cold himself  i do not like to interfere  as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr  and mrs  weston   but  upon my word  mr  elton  in your case  i should certainly excuse myself  you appear to me a little hoarse already  and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring  i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night    mr  elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make  which was exactly the case  for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady  and not liking to resist any advice of her   he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit    but emma  too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially  or see him with clear vision  was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being  very cold  certainly very cold   and walked on  rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls  and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening    you do quite right   said she    we will make your apologies to mr  and mrs  weston    but hardly had she so spoken  when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage  if the weather were mr  elton  only objection  and mr  elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction   it was a done thing  mr  elton was to go  and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment  never had his smile been stronger  nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her    well   said she to herself   this is most strange!  after i had got him off so well  to chuse to go into company  and leave harriet ill behind!  most strange indeed!  but there is  i believe  in many men  especially single men  such an inclination   such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures  their employments  their dignities  almost their duties  that any thing gives way to it  and this must be the case with mr  elton  a most valuable  amiable  pleasing young man undoubtedly  and very much in love with harriet  but still  he cannot refuse an invitation  he must dine out wherever he is asked  what a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in harriet  but will not dine alone for her    soon afterwards mr  elton quitted them  and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting  in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs  goddard  for news of her fair friend  the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again  when he hoped to be able to give a better report  and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour   after a few minutes of entire silence between them  john knightley began with     i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr  elton   it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned  with men he can be rational and unaffected  but when he has ladies to please  every feature works     mr  elton  manners are not perfect   replied emma   but where there is a wish to please  one ought to overlook  and one does overlook a great deal   where a man does his best with only moderate powers  he will have the advantage over negligent superiority   there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr  elton as one cannot but value     yes   said mr  john knightley presently  with some slyness   he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you     me!  she replied with a smile of astonishment   are you imagining me to be mr  elton  object     such an imagination has crossed me  i own  emma  and if it never occurred to you before  you may as well take it into consideration now     mr  elton in love with me!  what an idea!    i do not say it is so  but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not  and to regulate your behaviour accordingly  i think your manners to him encouraging   i speak as a friend  emma   you had better look about you  and ascertain what you do  and what you mean to do     i thank you  but i assure you you are quite mistaken   mr  elton and i are very good friends  and nothing more   and she walked on  amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances  of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into  and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant  and in want of counsel   he said no more   mr  woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit  that in spite of the increasing coldness  he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it  and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage  with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others  too full of the wonder of his own going  and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold  and too well wrapt up to feel it  the cold  however  was severe  and by the time the second carriage was in motion  a few flakes of snow were finding their way down  and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time   emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour  the preparing and the going abroad in such weather  with the sacrifice of his children after dinner  were evils  were disagreeables at least  which mr  john knightley did not by any means like  he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase  and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent    a man   said he   must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside  and encounter such a day as this  for the sake of coming to see him   he must think himself a most agreeable fellow  i could not do such a thing  it is the greatest absurdity  actually snowing at this moment!   the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home  and the folly of people  not staying comfortably at home when they can! if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this  by any call of duty or business  what a hardship we should deem it   and here are we  probably with rather thinner clothing than usual  setting forward voluntarily  without excuse  in defiance of the voice of nature  which tells man  in every thing given to his view or his feelings  to stay at home himself  and keep all under shelter that he can    here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man  house  with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday  and may not be said and heard again to morrow  going in dismal weather  to return probably in worse   four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle  shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home    emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent  which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving  to emulate the  very true  my love   which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion  but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all   she could not be complying  she dreaded being quarrelsome  her heroism reached only to silence   she allowed him to talk  and arranged the glasses  and wrapped herself up  without opening her lips   they arrived  the carriage turned  the step was let down  and mr  elton  spruce  black  and smiling  was with them instantly  emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject   mr  elton was all obligation and cheerfulness  he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed  that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her  she had sent while dressing  and the answer had been   much the same   not better      my  report from mrs  goddard    said she presently   was not so pleasant as i had hoped  `not better' was  my  answer    his face lengthened immediately  and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered    oh! no  i am grieved to find  i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs  goddard  door  which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress  i was told that miss smith was not better  by no means better  rather worse   very much grieved and concerned   i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning    emma smiled and answered   my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint  i hope  but not even i can charm away a sore throat  it is a most severe cold indeed   mr  perry has been with her  as you probably heard     yes  i imagined  that is  i did not      he has been used to her in these complaints  and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report   but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness   such a sad loss to our party to day!    dreadful!  exactly so  indeed   she will be missed every moment    this was very proper  the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable  but it should have lasted longer   emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things  and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment    what an excellent device   said he   the use of a sheepskin for carriages   how very comfortable they make it   impossible to feel cold with such precautions   the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman  carriage perfectly complete  one is so fenced and guarded from the weather  that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted   weather becomes absolutely of no consequence   it is a very cold afternoon  but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter   ha! snows a little i see     yes   said john knightley   and i think we shall have a good deal of it     christmas weather   observed mr  elton    quite seasonable  and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday  and prevent this day  party  which it might very possibly have done  for mr  woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground  but now it is of no consequence  this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings   at christmas every body invites their friends about them  and people think little of even the worst weather   i was snowed up at a friend  house once for a week   nothing could be pleasanter   i went for only one night  and could not get away till that very day se'nnight    mr  john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure  but said only  coolly    i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls    at another time emma might have been amused  but she was too much astonished now at mr  elton  spirits for other feelings  harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party    we are sure of excellent fires   continued he   and every thing in the greatest comfort   charming people  mr  and mrs  weston    mrs  weston indeed is much beyond praise  and he is exactly what one values  so hospitable  and so fond of society    it will be a small party  but where small parties are select  they are perhaps the most agreeable of any   mr  weston  dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably  and for my part  i would rather  under such circumstances  fall short by two than exceed by two   i think you will agree with me   turning with a soft air to emma   i think i shall certainly have your approbation  though mr  knightley perhaps  from being used to the large parties of london  may not quite enter into our feelings     i know nothing of the large parties of london  sir  i never dine with any body     indeed!  in a tone of wonder and pity   i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery   well  sir  the time must come when you will be paid for all this  when you will have little labour and great enjoyment     my first enjoyment   replied john knightley  as they passed through the sweep gate   will be to find myself safe at hartfield again      chapter xiv   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs  weston  drawing room   mr  elton must compose his joyous looks  and mr  john knightley disperse his ill humour  mr  elton must smile less  and mr  john knightley more  to fit them for the place   emma only might be as nature prompted  and shew herself just as happy as she was   to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons   mr  weston was a great favourite  and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve  as to his wife  not any one  to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood  of being always interesting and always intelligible  the little affairs  arrangements  perplexities  and pleasures of her father and herself  she could tell nothing of hartfield  in which mrs  weston had not a lively concern  and half an hour  uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends  was one of the first gratifications of each   this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day  visit might not afford  which certainly did not belong to the present half hour  but the very sight of mrs  weston  her smile  her touch  her voice was grateful to emma  and she determined to think as little as possible of mr  elton  oddities  or of any thing else unpleasant  and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost   the misfortune of harriet  cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival   mr  woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it  besides all the history of his own and isabella  coming  and of emma  being to follow  and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter  when the others appeared  and mrs  weston  who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him  was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma   emma  project of forgetting mr  elton for a while made her rather sorry to find  when they had all taken their places  that he was close to her   the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet  from her mind  while he not only sat at her elbow  but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice  and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion  instead of forgetting him  his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of  can it really be as my brother imagined  can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me   absurd and insufferable!    yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm  would be so interested about her father  and so delighted with mrs  weston  and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover  and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners  for her own sake she could not be rude  and for harriet   in the hope that all would yet turn out right  she was even positively civil  but it was an effort  especially as something was going on amongst the others  in the most overpowering period of mr  elton  nonsense  which she particularly wished to listen to   she heard enough to know that mr  weston was giving some information about his son  she heard the words  my son   and  frank   and  my son   repeated several times over  and  from a few other half syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son  but before she could quiet mr  elton  the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward   now  it so happened that in spite of emma  resolution of never marrying  there was something in the name  in the idea of mr  frank churchill  which always interested her   she had frequently thought  especially since his father  marriage with miss taylor  that if she  were  to marry  he was the very person to suit her in age  character and condition  he seemed by this connexion between the families  quite to belong to her  she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of   that mr  and mrs  weston did think of it  she was very strongly persuaded  and though not meaning to be induced by him  or by any body else  to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for  she had a great curiosity to see him  a decided intention of finding him pleasant  of being liked by him to a certain degree  and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations   with such sensations  mr  elton  civilities were dreadfully ill timed  but she had the comfort of appearing very polite  while feeling very cross  and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again  or the substance of it  from the open hearted mr  weston   so it proved    for when happily released from mr  elton  and seated by mr  weston  at dinner  he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality  the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton  to say to her    we want only two more to be just the right number   i should like to see two more here   your pretty little friend  miss smith  and my son  and then i should say we were quite complete  i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting frank   i had a letter from him this morning  and he will be with us within a fortnight    emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure  and fully assented to his proposition of mr  frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete    he has been wanting to come to us   continued mr  weston   ever since september   every letter has been full of it  but he cannot command his own time   he has those to please who must be pleased  and who  between ourselves  are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices   but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january     what a very great pleasure it will be to you! and mrs  weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him  that she must be almost as happy as yourself     yes  she would be  but that she thinks there will be another put off  she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do  but she does not know the parties so well as i do   the case  you see  is   but this is quite between ourselves   i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room   there are secrets in all families  you know   the case is  that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january  and that frank  coming depends upon their being put off   if they are not put off  he cannot stir  but i know they will  because it is a family that a certain lady  of some consequence  at enscombe  has a particular dislike to  and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years  they always are put off when it comes to the point  i have not the smallest doubt of the issue   i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january  as i am of being here myself   but your good friend there  nodding towards the upper end of the table  has so few vagaries herself  and has been so little used to them at hartfield  that she cannot calculate on their effects  as i have been long in the practice of doing     i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case   replied emma   but am disposed to side with you  mr  weston   if you think he will come  i shall think so too  for you know enscombe     yes  i have some right to that knowledge  though i have never been at the place in my life   she is an odd woman!  but i never allow myself to speak ill of her  on frank  account  for i do believe her to be very fond of him   i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body  except herself   but she has always been kind to him  in her way  allowing for little whims and caprices  and expecting every thing to be as she likes   and it is no small credit  in my opinion  to him  that he should excite such an affection  for  though i would not say it to any body else  she has no more heart than a stone to people in general  and the devil of a temper    emma liked the subject so well  that she began upon it  to mrs  weston  very soon after their moving into the drawing room  wishing her joy   yet observing  that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming    mrs  weston agreed to it  but added  that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of    for i cannot depend upon his coming  i cannot be so sanguine as mr  weston   i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing   mr  weston  i dare say  has been telling you exactly how the matter stands     yes  it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs  churchill  which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world     my emma!  replied mrs  weston  smiling   what is the certainty of caprice    then turning to isabella  who had not been attending before   you must know  my dear mrs  knightley  that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr  frank churchill  in my opinion  as his father thinks   it depends entirely upon his aunt  spirits and pleasure  in short  upon her temper  to you  to my two daughters  i may venture on the truth  mrs  churchill rules at enscombe  and is a very odd tempered woman  and his coming now  depends upon her being willing to spare him     oh  mrs  churchill  every body knows mrs  churchill   replied isabella    and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion   to be constantly living with an ill tempered person  must be dreadful   it is what we happily have never known any thing of  but it must be a life of misery   what a blessing  that she never had any children! poor little creatures  how unhappy she would have made them!   emma wished she had been alone with mrs  weston   she should then have heard more   mrs  weston would speak to her  with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella  and  she really believed  would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her  excepting those views on the young man  of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge  but at present there was nothing more to be said   mr  woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room  to be sitting long after dinner  was a confinement that he could not endure  neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him  and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable   while he talked to isabella  however  emma found an opportunity of saying    and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain   i am sorry for it   the introduction must be unpleasant  whenever it takes place  and the sooner it could be over  the better     yes  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays  even if this family  the braithwaites  are put off  i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us  i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side  but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills' to keep him to themselves  there is jealousy   they are jealous even of his regard for his father  in short  i can feel no dependence on his coming  and i wish mr  weston were less sanguine     he ought to come   said emma    if he could stay only a couple of days  he ought to come  and one can hardly conceive a young man  not having it in his power to do as much as that   a young  woman   if she fall into bad hands  may be teazed  and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with  but one cannot comprehend a young  man   being under such restraint  as not to be able to spend a week with his father  if he likes it     one ought to be at enscombe  and know the ways of the family  before one decides upon what he can do   replied mrs  weston   one ought to use the same caution  perhaps  in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family  but enscombe  i believe  certainly must not be judged by general rules   she  is so very unreasonable  and every thing gives way to her     but she is so fond of the nephew   he is so very great a favourite  now  according to my idea of mrs  churchill  it would be most natural  that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband  to whom she owes every thing  while she exercises incessant caprice towards  him   she should frequently be governed by the nephew  to whom she owes nothing at all     my dearest emma  do not pretend  with your sweet temper  to understand a bad one  or to lay down rules for it   you must let it go its own way   i have no doubt of his having  at times  considerable influence  but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand  when  it will be    emma listened  and then coolly said   i shall not be satisfied  unless he comes     he may have a great deal of influence on some points   continued mrs  weston   and on others  very little   and among those  on which she is beyond his reach  it is but too likely  may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us      chapter xv   mr  woodhouse was soon ready for his tea  and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home  and it was as much as his three companions could do  to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour  before the other gentlemen appeared   mr  weston was chatty and convivial  and no friend to early separations of any sort  but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation  mr  elton  in very good spirits  was one of the first to walk in  mrs  weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa   he joined them immediately  and  with scarcely an invitation  seated himself between them   emma  in good spirits too  from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr  frank churchill  was willing to forget his late improprieties  and be as well satisfied with him as before  and on his making harriet his very first subject  was ready to listen with most friendly smiles   he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend   her fair  lovely  amiable friend    did she know   had she heard any thing about her  since their being at randalls    he felt much anxiety  he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably    and in this style he talked on for some time very properly  not much attending to any answer  but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat  and emma was quite in charity with him   but at last there seemed a perverse turn  it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account  than on harriet   more anxious that she should escape the infection  than that there should be no infection in the complaint   he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again  for the present  to entreat her to  promise   him  not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr  perry and learnt his opinion  and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course  there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her   she was vexed  it did appear  there was no concealing it  exactly like the pretence of being in love with her  instead of harriet  an inconstancy  if real  the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper   he turned to mrs  weston to implore her assistance   would not she give him her support   would not she add her persuasions to his  to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs  goddard  till it were certain that miss smith  disorder had no infection   he could not be satisfied without a promise   would not she give him her influence in procuring it     so scrupulous for others   he continued   and yet so careless for herself!  she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day  and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself   is this fair  mrs  weston   judge between us  have not i some right to complain   i am sure of your kind support and aid    emma saw mrs  weston  surprize  and felt that it must be great  at an address which  in words and manner  was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her  and as for herself  she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose   she could only give him a look  but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses  and then left the sofa  removing to a seat by her sister  and giving her all her attention   she had not time to know how mr  elton took the reproof  so rapidly did another subject succeed  for mr  john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather  and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow  and of its still snowing fast  with a strong drifting wind  concluding with these words to mr  woodhouse    this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements  sir   something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow    poor mr  woodhouse was silent from consternation  but every body else had something to say  every body was either surprized or not surprized  and had some question to ask  or some comfort to offer   mrs  weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son in law  who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly    i admired your resolution very much  sir   said he   in venturing out in such weather  for of course you saw there would be snow very soon   every body must have seen the snow coming on  i admired your spirit  and i dare say we shall get home very well  another hour or two  snow can hardly make the road impassable  and we are two carriages  if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand   i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight    mr  weston  with triumph of a different sort  was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time  but had not said a word  lest it should make mr  woodhouse uncomfortable  and be an excuse for his hurrying away   as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return  that was a mere joke  he was afraid they would find no difficulty   he wished the road might be impassable  that he might be able to keep them all at randalls  and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body  calling on his wife to agree with him  that with a little contrivance  every body might be lodged  which she hardly knew how to do  from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house    what is to be done  my dear emma   what is to be done   was mr  woodhouse  first exclamation  and all that he could say for some time   to her he looked for comfort  and her assurances of safety  her representation of the excellence of the horses  and of james  and of their having so many friends about them  revived him a little   his eldest daughter  alarm was equal to his own   the horror of being blocked up at randalls  while her children were at hartfield  was full in her imagination  and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people  but in a state that admitted no delay  she was eager to have it settled  that her father and emma should remain at randalls  while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them    you had better order the carriage directly  my love   said she   i dare say we shall be able to get along  if we set off directly  and if we do come to any thing very bad  i can get out and walk  i am not at all afraid   i should not mind walking half the way  i could change my shoes  you know  the moment i got home  and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold     indeed!  replied he    then  my dear isabella  it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world  for in general every thing does give you cold   walk home!  you are prettily shod for walking home  i dare say   it will be bad enough for the horses    isabella turned to mrs  weston for her approbation of the plan  mrs  weston could only approve   isabella then went to emma  but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away  and they were still discussing the point  when mr  knightley  who had left the room immediately after his brother  first report of the snow  came back again  and told them that he had been out of doors to examine  and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home  whenever they liked it  either now or an hour hence   he had gone beyond the sweep   some way along the highbury road  the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep  in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground  a very few flakes were falling at present  but the clouds were parting  and there was every appearance of its being soon over   he had seen the coachmen  and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend   to isabella  the relief of such tidings was very great  and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father  account  who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed  but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls   he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home  but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay  and while the others were variously urging and recommending  mr  knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences   thus     your father will not be easy  why do not you go     i am ready  if the others are     shall i ring the bell     yes  do    and the bell was rung  and the carriages spoken for   a few minutes more  and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house  to get sober and cool  and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over   the carriage came   and mr  woodhouse  always the first object on such occasions  was carefully attended to his own by mr  knightley and mr  weston  but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen  and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for   he was afraid they should have a very bad drive   he was afraid poor isabella would not like it   and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind   he did not know what they had best do  they must keep as much together as they could   and james was talked to  and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage   isabella stept in after her father  john knightley  forgetting that he did not belong to their party  stept in after his wife very naturally  so that emma found  on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr  elton  that the door was to be lawfully shut on them  and that they were to have a tete a tete drive   it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment  it would have been rather a pleasure  previous to the suspicions of this very day  she could have talked to him of harriet  and the three quarters of a mile would have seemed but one   but now  she would rather it had not happened  she believed he had been drinking too much of mr  weston  good wine  and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense   to restrain him as much as might be  by her own manners  she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night  but scarcely had she begun  scarcely had they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage  than she found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded  and mr  elton actually making violent love to her   availing himself of the precious opportunity  declaring sentiments which must be already well known  hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him  but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect  and in short  very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible   it really was so   without scruple  without apology   without much apparent diffidence  mr  elton  the lover of harriet  was professing himself  her  lover   she tried to stop him  but vainly  he would go on  and say it all   angry as she was  the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak  she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness  and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour  accordingly  with a mixture of the serious and the playful  which she hoped would best suit his half and half state  she replied    i am very much astonished  mr  elton   this to  me ! you forget yourself   you take me for my friend  any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver  but no more of this to  me   if you please     miss smith!  message to miss smith!  what could she possibly mean!    and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent  such boastful pretence of amazement  that she could not help replying with quickness    mr  elton  this is the most extraordinary conduct! and i can account for it only in one way  you are not yourself  or you could not speak either to me  or of harriet  in such a manner   command yourself enough to say no more  and i will endeavour to forget it    but mr  elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits  not at all to confuse his intellects   he perfectly knew his own meaning  and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious  and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend    but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all   he resumed the subject of his own passion  and was very urgent for a favourable answer   as she thought less of his inebriety  she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption  and with fewer struggles for politeness  replied    it is impossible for me to doubt any longer   you have made yourself too clear   mr  elton  my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express   after such behaviour  as i have witnessed during the last month  to miss smith  such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing  to be addressing me in this manner  this is an unsteadiness of character  indeed  which i had not supposed possible!  believe me  sir  i am far  very far  from gratified in being the object of such professions     good heaven!  cried mr  elton   what can be the meaning of this    miss smith!  i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence  never paid her any attentions  but as your friend  never cared whether she were dead or alive  but as your friend  if she has fancied otherwise  her own wishes have misled her  and i am very sorry  extremely sorry  but  miss smith  indeed!  oh! miss woodhouse! who can think of miss smith  when miss woodhouse is near!  no  upon my honour  there is no unsteadiness of character  i have thought only of you   i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else   every thing that i have said or done  for many weeks past  has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself   you cannot really  seriously  doubt it  no!   in an accent meant to be insinuating   i am sure you have seen and understood me    it would be impossible to say what emma felt  on hearing this   which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost   she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply  and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr  elton  sanguine state of mind  he tried to take her hand again  as he joyously exclaimed     charming miss woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence  it confesses that you have long understood me     no  sir   cried emma   it confesses no such thing   so far from having long understood you  i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views  till this moment   as to myself  i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings   nothing could be farther from my wishes  your attachment to my friend harriet  your pursuit of her   pursuit  it appeared   gave me great pleasure  and i have been very earnestly wishing you success  but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield  i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent   am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith   that you have never thought seriously of her     never  madam   cried he  affronted in his turn    never  i assure you   i  think seriously of miss smith!  miss smith is a very good sort of girl  and i should be happy to see her respectably settled  i wish her extremely well   and  no doubt  there are men who might not object to  every body has their level   but as for myself  i am not  i think  quite so much at a loss   i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance  as to be addressing myself to miss smith!   no  madam  my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only  and the encouragement i received      encouragement!  i give you encouragement!  sir  you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it   i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend   in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance   i am exceedingly sorry   but it is well that the mistake ends where it does   had the same behaviour continued  miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views  not being aware  probably  any more than myself  of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of   but  as it is  the disappointment is single  and  i trust  will not be lasting  i have no thoughts of matrimony at present    he was too angry to say another word  her manner too decided to invite supplication  and in this state of swelling resentment  and mutually deep mortification  they had to continue together a few minutes longer  for the fears of mr  woodhouse had confined them to a foot pace  if there had not been so much anger  there would have been desperate awkwardness  but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment   without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane  or when it stopped  they found themselves  all at once  at the door of his house  and he was out before another syllable passed   emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night   the compliment was just returned  coldly and proudly  and  under indescribable irritation of spirits  she was then conveyed to hartfield   there she was welcomed  with the utmost delight  by her father  who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of   and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no james  and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well  for mr  john knightley  ashamed of his ill humour  was now all kindness and attention  and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father  as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome  and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party  except herself   but her mind had never been in such perturbation  and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection     chapter xvi   the hair was curled  and the maid sent away  and emma sat down to think and be miserable   it was a wretched business indeed!  such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!  such a development of every thing most unwelcome!  such a blow for harriet!  that was the worst of all   every part of it brought pain and humiliation  of some sort or other  but  compared with the evil to harriet  all was light  and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken   more in error  more disgraced by mis judgment  than she actually was  could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself    if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man  i could have borne any thing   he might have doubled his presumption to me   but poor harriet!   how she could have been so deceived!  he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet  never!  she looked back as well as she could  but it was all confusion   she had taken up the idea  she supposed  and made every thing bend to it  his manners  however  must have been unmarked  wavering  dubious  or she could not have been so misled   the picture!  how eager he had been about the picture!   and the charade!  and an hundred other circumstances    how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet   to be sure  the charade  with its  ready wit   but then the  soft eyes    in fact it suited neither  it was a jumble without taste or truth  who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense   certainly she had often  especially of late  thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant  but it had passed as his way  as a mere error of judgment  of knowledge  of taste  as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society  that with all the gentleness of his address  true elegance was sometimes wanting  but  till this very day  she had never  for an instant  suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet  friend   to mr  john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject  for the first start of its possibility   there was no denying that those brothers had penetration   she remembered what mr  knightley had once said to her about mr  elton  the caution he had given  the conviction he had professed that mr  elton would never marry indiscreetly  and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself   it was dreadfully mortifying  but mr  elton was proving himself  in many respects  the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him  proud  assuming  conceited  very full of his own claims  and little concerned about the feelings of others   contrary to the usual course of things  mr  elton  wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion  his professions and his proposals did him no service   she thought nothing of his attachment  and was insulted by his hopes  he wanted to marry well  and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her  pretended to be in love  but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for  there had been no real affection either in his language or manners  sighs and fine words had been given in abundance  but she could hardly devise any set of expressions  or fancy any tone of voice  less allied with real love   she need not trouble herself to pity him  he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself  and if miss woodhouse of hartfield  the heiress of thirty thousand pounds  were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied  he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty  or with ten   but  that he should talk of encouragement  should consider her as aware of his views  accepting his attentions  meaning  in short   to marry him!  should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!  look down upon her friend  so well understanding the gradations of rank below him  and be so blind to what rose above  as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!   it was most provoking   perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent  and all the elegancies of mind  the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it  but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior   he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield  the younger branch of a very ancient family  and that the eltons were nobody  the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable  being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate  to which all the rest of highbury belonged  but their fortune  from other sources  was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself  in every other kind of consequence  and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr  elton had first entered not two years ago  to make his way as he could  without any alliances but in trade  or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility    but he had fancied her in love with him  that evidently must have been his dependence  and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head  emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging  so full of courtesy and attention  as  supposing her real motive unperceived  might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy  like mr  elton  in fancying himself a very decided favourite   if  she  had so misinterpreted his feelings  she had little right to wonder that  he   with self interest to blind him  should have mistaken hers   the first error and the worst lay at her door   it was foolish  it was wrong  to take so active a part in bringing any two people together   it was adventuring too far  assuming too much  making light of what ought to be serious  a trick of what ought to be simple   she was quite concerned and ashamed  and resolved to do such things no more    here have i   said she   actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man   she might never have thought of him but for me  and certainly never would have thought of him with hope  if i had not assured her of his attachment  for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him   oh! that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin   there i was quite right  that was well done of me  but there i should have stopped  and left the rest to time and chance   i was introducing her into good company  and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having  i ought not to have attempted more   but now  poor girl  her peace is cut up for some time   i have been but half a friend to her  and if she were  not  to feel this disappointment so very much  i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her   william coxe  oh! no  i could not endure william coxe   a pert young lawyer    she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse  and then resumed a more serious  more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been  and might be  and must be   the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet  and all that poor harriet would be suffering  with the awkwardness of future meetings  the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance  of subduing feelings  concealing resentment  and avoiding eclat  were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer  and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully   to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma   though under temporary gloom at night  the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits   the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy  and of powerful operation  and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed  they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope   emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed  more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her  and to depend on getting tolerably out of it   it was a great consolation that mr  elton should not be really in love with her  or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him  that harriet  nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive   and that there could be no necessity for any body  knowing what had passed except the three principals  and especially for her father  being given a moment  uneasiness about it   these were very cheering thoughts  and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service  for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present   the weather was most favourable for her  though christmas day  she could not go to church   mr  woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it  and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas  the ground covered with snow  and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw  which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise  every morning beginning in rain or snow  and every evening setting in to freeze  she was for many days a most honourable prisoner   no intercourse with harriet possible but by note  no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day  and no need to find excuses for mr  elton  absenting himself   it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home  and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other  it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house  too wise to stir out  and to hear him say to mr  knightley  whom no weather could keep entirely from them      ah!  mr  knightley  why do not you stay at home like poor mr  elton    these days of confinement would have been  but for her private perplexities  remarkably comfortable  as such seclusion exactly suited her brother  whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions  and he had  besides  so thoroughly cleared off his ill humour at randalls  that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield   he was always agreeable and obliging  and speaking pleasantly of every body   but with all the hopes of cheerfulness  and all the present comfort of delay  there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet  as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease     chapter xvii   mr  and mrs  john knightley were not detained long at hartfield  the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move  and mr  woodhouse having  as usual  tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children  was obliged to see the whole party set off  and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella   which poor isabella  passing her life with those she doated on  full of their merits  blind to their faults  and always innocently busy  might have been a model of right feminine happiness   the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr  elton to mr  woodhouse  a long  civil  ceremonious note  to say  with mr  elton  best compliments   that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath  where  in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends  he had engaged to spend a few weeks  and very much regretted the impossibility he was under  from various circumstances of weather and business  of taking a personal leave of mr  woodhouse  of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense   and had mr  woodhouse any commands  should be happy to attend to them    emma was most agreeably surprized   mr  elton  absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired   she admired him for contriving it  though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced   resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father  from which she was so pointedly excluded   she had not even a share in his opening compliments   her name was not mentioned    and there was so striking a change in all this  and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments  as she thought  at first  could not escape her father  suspicion   it did  however   her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey  and his fears that mr  elton might never get safely to the end of it  and saw nothing extraordinary in his language  it was a very useful note  for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening  mr  woodhouse talked over his alarms  and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude   she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark   she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold  and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman  return  she went to mrs  goddard  accordingly the very next day  to undergo the necessary penance of communication  and a severe one it was    she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding  to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred   and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject  all her observations  all her convictions  all her prophecies for the last six weeks   the confession completely renewed her first shame  and the sight of harriet  tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again   harriet bore the intelligence very well  blaming nobody   and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself  as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend   emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost  and all that was amiable  all that ought to be attaching  seemed on harriet  side  not her own   harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of   the affection of such a man as mr  elton would have been too great a distinction    she never could have deserved him  and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible   her tears fell abundantly  but her grief was so truly artless  that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma  eyes   and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding  really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two  and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do   it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded and ignorant  but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet  and repressing imagination all the rest of her life   her second duty now  inferior only to her father  claims  was to promote harriet  comfort  and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making  she got her to hartfield  and shewed her the most unvarying kindness  striving to occupy and amuse her  and by books and conversation  to drive mr  elton from her thoughts   time  she knew  must be allowed for this being thoroughly done  and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general  and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr  elton in particular  but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet  age  and with the entire extinction of all hope  such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr  elton  return  as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance  without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them   harriet did think him all perfection  and maintained the non existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did  in truth  prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen  but yet it appeared to her so natural  so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort  unrequited   that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force   if mr  elton  on his return  made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do  she could not imagine harriet  persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him   their being fixed  so absolutely fixed  in the same place  was bad for each  for all three   not one of them had the power of removal  or of effecting any material change of society   they must encounter each other  and make the best of it   harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs  goddard   mr  elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school  and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth   where the wound had been given  there must the cure be found if anywhere  and emma felt that  till she saw her in the way of cure  there could be no true peace for herself     chapter xviii   mr  frank churchill did not come   when the time proposed drew near  mrs  weston  fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse   for the present  he could not be spared  to his  very great mortification and regret  but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period    mrs  weston was exceedingly disappointed  much more disappointed  in fact  than her husband  though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober   but a sanguine temper  though for ever expecting more good than occurs  does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression  it soon flies over the present failure  and begins to hope again  for half an hour mr  weston was surprized and sorry  but then he began to perceive that frank  coming two or three months later would be a much better plan  better time of year  better weather  and that he would be able  without any doubt  to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner   these feelings rapidly restored his comfort  while mrs  weston  of a more apprehensive disposition  foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays  and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer  suffered a great deal more herself   emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr  frank churchill  not coming  except as a disappointment at randalls   the acquaintance at present had no charm for her  she wanted  rather  to be quiet  and out of temptation  but still  as it was desirable that she should appear  in general  like her usual self  she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance  and enter as warmly into mr  and mrs  weston  disappointment  as might naturally belong to their friendship   she was the first to announce it to mr  knightley  and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary   or  being acting a part  perhaps rather more   at the conduct of the churchills  in keeping him away  she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt  of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry  the pleasure of looking at somebody new  the gala day to highbury entire  which the sight of him would have made  and ending with reflections on the churchills again  found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr  knightley  and  to her great amusement  perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion  and making use of mrs  weston  arguments against herself    the churchills are very likely in fault   said mr  knightley  coolly   but i dare say he might come if he would     i do not know why you should say so   he wishes exceedingly to come  but his uncle and aunt will not spare him     i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming  if he made a point of it   it is too unlikely  for me to believe it without proof     how odd you are!  what has mr  frank churchill done  to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature     i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature  in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions  and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure  from living with those who have always set him the example of it   it is a great deal more natural than one could wish  that a young man  brought up by those who are proud  luxurious  and selfish  should be proud  luxurious  and selfish too   if frank churchill had wanted to see his father  he would have contrived it between september and january  a man at his age  what is he   three or four and twenty  cannot be without the means of doing as much as that   it is impossible     that  easily said  and easily felt by you  who have always been your own master   you are the worst judge in the world  mr  knightley  of the difficulties of dependence   you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage     it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount   he cannot want money  he cannot want leisure   we know  on the contrary  that he has so much of both  that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom   we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other   a little while ago  he was at weymouth  this proves that he can leave the churchills     yes  sometimes he can     and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while  whenever there is any temptation of pleasure     it is very unfair to judge of any body  conduct  without an intimate knowledge of their situation   nobody  who has not been in the interior of a family  can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be   we ought to be acquainted with enscombe  and with mrs  churchill  temper  before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do  he may  at times  be able to do a great deal more than he can at others     there is one thing  emma  which a man can always do  if he chuses  and that is  his duty  not by manoeuvring and finessing  but by vigour and resolution   it is frank churchill  duty to pay this attention to his father   he knows it to be so  by his promises and messages  but if he wished to do it  it might be done   a man who felt rightly would say at once  simply and resolutely  to mrs  churchill   `every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience  but i must go and see my father immediately  i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion   i shall  therefore  set off to morrow '   if he would say so to her at once  in the tone of decision becoming a man  there would be no opposition made to his going     no   said emma  laughing   but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again   such language for a young man entirely dependent  to use!  nobody but you  mr  knightley  would imagine it possible  but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own   mr  frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt  who have brought him up  and are to provide for him!  standing up in the middle of the room  i suppose  and speaking as loud as he could!  how can you imagine such conduct practicable     depend upon it  emma  a sensible man would find no difficulty in it  he would feel himself in the right  and the declaration  made  of course  as a man of sense would make it  in a proper manner   would do him more good  raise him higher  fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on  than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do   respect would be added to affection  they would feel that they could trust him  that the nephew who had done rightly by his father  would do rightly by them  for they know  as well as he does  as well as all the world must know  that he ought to pay this visit to his father  and while meanly exerting their power to delay it  are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims   respect for right conduct is felt by every body   if he would act in this sort of manner  on principle  consistently  regularly  their little minds would bend to his     i rather doubt that   you are very fond of bending little minds  but where little minds belong to rich people in authority  i think they have a knack of swelling out  till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones   i can imagine  that if you  as you are  mr  knightley  were to be transported and placed all at once in mr  frank churchill  situation  you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him  and it might have a very good effect   the churchills might not have a word to say in return  but then  you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through   to him who has  it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence  and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought  he may have as strong a sense of what would be right  as you can have  without being so equal  under particular circumstances  to act up to it     then it would not be so strong a sense   if it failed to produce equal exertion  it could not be an equal conviction     oh  the difference of situation and habit!  i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those  whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life     our amiable young man is a very weak young man  if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others   it ought to have been a habit with him by this time  of following his duty  instead of consulting expediency  i can allow for the fears of the child  but not of the man  as he became rational  he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority   he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father  had he begun as he ought  there would have been no difficulty now     we shall never agree about him   cried emma   but that is nothing extraordinary   i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man   i feel sure that he is not   mr  weston would not be blind to folly  though in his own son  but he is very likely to have a more yielding  complying  mild disposition than would suit your notions of man  perfection   i dare say he has  and though it may cut him off from some advantages  it will secure him many others     yes  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move  and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure  and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it   he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter  full of professions and falsehoods  and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father  having any right to complain   his letters disgust me     your feelings are singular   they seem to satisfy every body else     i suspect they do not satisfy mrs  weston   they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings   standing in a mother  place  but without a mother  affection to blind her  it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due  and she must doubly feel the omission   had she been a person of consequence herself  he would have come i dare say  and it would not have signified whether he did or no   can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations   do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself   no  emma  your amiable young man can be amiable only in french  not in english   he may be very `aimable ' have very good manners  and be very agreeable  but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people  nothing really amiable about him     you seem determined to think ill of him     me!  not at all   replied mr  knightley  rather displeased   i do not want to think ill of him   i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man  but i hear of none  except what are merely personal  that he is well grown and good looking  with smooth  plausible manners     well  if he have nothing else to recommend him  he will be a treasure at highbury   we do not often look upon fine young men  well bred and agreeable   we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain   cannot you imagine  mr  knightley  what a  sensation  his coming will produce   there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury  but one interest   one object of curiosity  it will be all mr  frank churchill  we shall think and speak of nobody else     you will excuse my being so much over powered  if i find him conversable  i shall be glad of his acquaintance  but if he is only a chattering coxcomb  he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts     my idea of him is  that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body  and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable   to you  he will talk of farming  to me  of drawing or music  and so on to every body  having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead  or take the lead  just as propriety may require  and to speak extremely well on each  that is my idea of him     and mine   said mr  knightley warmly   is  that if he turn out any thing like it  he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! what! at three and twenty to be the king of his company  the great man   the practised politician  who is to read every body  character  and make every body  talents conduce to the display of his own superiority  to be dispensing his flatteries around  that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself!  my dear emma  your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point     i will say no more about him   cried emma   you turn every thing to evil   we are both prejudiced  you against  i for him  and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here     prejudiced!  i am not prejudiced     but i am very much  and without being at all ashamed of it  my love for mr  and mrs  weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour     he is a person i never think of from one month  end to another   said mr  knightley  with a degree of vexation  which made emma immediately talk of something else  though she could not comprehend why he should be angry   to take a dislike to a young man  only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself  was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him  for with all the high opinion of himself  which she had often laid to his charge  she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another      volume ii    chapter i   emma and harriet had been walking together one morning  and  in emma  opinion  had been talking enough of mr  elton for that day  she could not think that harriet  solace or her own sins required more  and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned   but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded  and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter  and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive    mr  elton is so good to the poor!  she found something else must be done   they were just approaching the house where lived mrs  and miss bates  she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers  there was always sufficient reason for such an attention  mrs  and miss bates loved to be called on  and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her  as rather negligent in that respect  and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts   she had had many a hint from mr  knightley and some from her own heart  as to her deficiency  but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable   a waste of time  tiresome women   and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate and third rate of highbury  who were calling on them for ever  and therefore she seldom went near them   but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in  observing  as she proposed it to harriet  that  as well as she could calculate  they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax   the house belonged to people in business   mrs  and miss bates occupied the drawing room floor  and there  in the very moderate sized apartment  which was every thing to them  the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed  the quiet neat old lady  who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner  wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse  and her more active  talking daughter  almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness  thanks for their visit  solicitude for their shoes  anxious inquiries after mr  woodhouse  health  cheerful communications about her mother   and sweet cake from the beaufet   mrs  cole had just been there  just called in for ten minutes  and had been so good as to sit an hour with them  and  she  had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much  and  therefore  she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too    the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr  elton  there was intimacy between them  and mr  cole had heard from mr  elton since his going away   emma knew what was coming  they must have the letter over again  and settle how long he had been gone  and how much he was engaged in company  and what a favourite he was wherever he went  and how full the master of the ceremonies' ball had been  and she went through it very well  with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite  and always putting forward to prevent harriet  being obliged to say a word   this she had been prepared for when she entered the house  but meant  having once talked him handsomely over  to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic  and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury  and their card parties  she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr  elton  but he was actually hurried off by miss bates  she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles  to usher in a letter from her niece    oh! yes  mr  elton  i understand  certainly as to dancing   mrs  cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was   mrs  cole was so kind as to sit some time with us  talking of jane  for as soon as she came in  she began inquiring after her  jane is so very great a favourite there   whenever she is with us  mrs  cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough  and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can  and so she began inquiring after her directly  saying  `i know you cannot have heard from jane lately  because it is not her time for writing ' and when i immediately said  `but indeed we have  we had a letter this very morning ' i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized   `have you  upon your honour ' said she  `well  that is quite unexpected   do let me hear what she says '   emma  politeness was at hand directly  to say  with smiling interest     have you heard from miss fairfax so lately   i am extremely happy  i hope she is well     thank you   you are so kind!  replied the happily deceived aunt  while eagerly hunting for the letter    oh! here it is   i was sure it could not be far off  but i had put my huswife upon it  you see  without being aware  and so it was quite hid  but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table  i was reading it to mrs  cole  and since she went away  i was reading it again to my mother  for it is such a pleasure to her   a letter from jane  that she can never hear it often enough  so i knew it could not be far off  and here it is  only just under my huswife  and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says   but  first of all  i really must  in justice to jane  apologise for her writing so short a letter  only two pages you see   hardly two  and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half  my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well  she often says  when the letter is first opened  `well  hetty  now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work'   don't you  ma'am   and then i tell her  i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself  if she had nobody to do it for her   every word of it  i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word   and  indeed  though my mother  eyes are not so good as they were  she can see amazingly well still  thank god! with the help of spectacles   it is such a blessing!  my mother  are really very good indeed   jane often says  when she is here  `i am sure  grandmama  you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do  and so much fine work as you have done too!  i only wish my eyes may last me as well '   all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath  and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax  handwriting    you are extremely kind   replied miss bates  highly gratified   you who are such a judge  and write so beautifully yourself  i am sure there is nobody  praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse   my mother does not hear  she is a little deaf you know   ma'am   addressing her   do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane  handwriting    and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it  she was pondering  in the meanwhile  upon the possibility  without seeming very rude  of making her escape from jane fairfax  letter  and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse  when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention    my mother  deafness is very trifling you see  just nothing at all  by only raising my voice  and saying any thing two or three times over  she is sure to hear  but then she is used to my voice   but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me  jane speaks so distinct!  however  she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago  which is saying a great deal at my mother  time of life  and it really is full two years  you know  since she was here   we never were so long without seeing her before  and as i was telling mrs  cole  we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now     are you expecting miss fairfax here soon     oh yes  next week     indeed!  that must be a very great pleasure     thank you   you are very kind   yes  next week   every body is so surprized  and every body says the same obliging things   i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury  as they can be to see her   yes  friday or saturday  she cannot say which  because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days   so very good of them to send her the whole way! but they always do  you know   oh yes  friday or saturday next  that is what she writes about   that is the reason of her writing out of rule  as we call it  for  in the common course  we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday     yes  so i imagined   i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day     so obliging of you!  no  we should not have heard  if it had not been for this particular circumstance  of her being to come here so soon   my mother is so delighted!  for she is to be three months with us at least   three months  she says so  positively  as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you   the case is  you see  that the campbells are going to ireland   mrs  dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly  they had not intended to go over till the summer  but she is so impatient to see them again  for till she married  last october  she was never away from them so much as a week  which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms  i was going to say  but however different countries  and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother  or her father  i declare i do not know which it was  but we shall see presently in jane  letter  wrote in mr  dixon  name as well as her own  to press their coming over directly  and they would give them the meeting in dublin  and take them back to their country seat  baly craig  a beautiful place  i fancy  jane has heard a great deal of its beauty  from mr  dixon  i mean   i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else  but it was very natural  you know  that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses  and as jane used to be very often walking out with them  for colonel and mrs  campbell were very particular about their daughter  not walking out often with only mr  dixon  for which i do not at all blame them  of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland  and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place  views that he had taken himself   he is a most amiable  charming young man  i believe   jane was quite longing to go to ireland  from his account of things    at this moment  an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma  brain with regard to jane fairfax  this charming mr  dixon  and the not going to ireland  she said  with the insidious design of farther discovery    you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time   considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs  dixon  you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs  campbell     very true  very true  indeed   the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of  for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us  for months together  not able to come if any thing was to happen   but you see  every thing turns out for the best   they want her  mr  and mrs  dixon  excessively to come over with colonel and mrs  campbell  quite depend upon it  nothing can be more kind or pressing than their  joint  invitation  jane says  as you will hear presently  mr  dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention   he is a most charming young man  ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth  when they were out in that party on the water  and she  by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails  would have been dashed into the sea at once  and actually was all but gone  if he had not  with the greatest presence of mind  caught hold of her habit    i can never think of it without trembling!   but ever since we had the history of that day  i have been so fond of mr  dixon!    but  in spite of all her friends' urgency  and her own wish of seeing ireland  miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs  bates     yes  entirely her own doing  entirely her own choice  and colonel and mrs  campbell think she does quite right  just what they should recommend  and indeed they particularly  wish  her to try her native air  as she has not been quite so well as usual lately     i am concerned to hear of it   i think they judge wisely  but mrs  dixon must be very much disappointed   mrs  dixon  i understand  has no remarkable degree of personal beauty  is not  by any means  to be compared with miss fairfax     oh! no   you are very obliging to say such things  but certainly not  there is no comparison between them   miss campbell always was absolutely plain  but extremely elegant and amiable     yes  that of course     jane caught a bad cold  poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of november   as i am going to read to you   and has never been well since   a long time  is not it  for a cold to hang upon her  she never mentioned it before  because she would not alarm us  just like her! so considerate!  but however  she is so far from well  that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home  and try an air that always agrees with her  and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her   and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here  than go to ireland  if she is unwell  nobody could nurse her  as we should do     it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world     and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday  and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following   as you will find from jane  letter   so sudden!  you may guess  dear miss woodhouse  what a flurry it has thrown me in! if it was not for the drawback of her illness  but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin  and looking very poorly  i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me  as to that  i always make a point of reading jane  letters through to myself first  before i read them aloud to my mother  you know  for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her   jane desired me to do it  so i always do   and so i began to day with my usual caution  but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell  than i burst out  quite frightened  with `bless me! poor jane is ill!'   which my mother  being on the watch  heard distinctly  and was sadly alarmed at   however  when i read on  i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first  and i make so light of it now to her  that she does not think much about it   but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard   if jane does not get well soon  we will call in mr  perry   the expense shall not be thought of  and though he is so liberal  and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance  we could not suffer it to be so  you know   he has a wife and family to maintain  and is not to be giving away his time   well  now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about  we will turn to her letter  and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her     i am afraid we must be running away   said emma  glancing at harriet  and beginning to rise   my father will be expecting us  i had no intention  i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes  when i first entered the house   i merely called  because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs  bates  but i have been so pleasantly detained!  now  however  we must wish you and mrs  bates good morning    and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded  she regained the street  happy in this  that though much had been forced on her against her will  though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax  letter  she had been able to escape the letter itself     chapter ii   jane fairfax was an orphan  the only child of mrs  bates  youngest daughter   the marriage of lieut  fairfax of the         regiment of infantry  and miss jane bates  had had its day of fame and pleasure  hope and interest  but nothing now remained of it  save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad  of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards  and this girl   by birth she belonged to highbury   and when at three years old  on losing her mother  she became the property  the charge  the consolation  the fondling of her grandmother and aunt  there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there  of her being taught only what very limited means could command  and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement  to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person  good understanding  and warm hearted  well meaning relations   but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny   this was colonel campbell  who had very highly regarded fairfax  as an excellent officer and most deserving young man  and farther  had been indebted to him for such attentions  during a severe camp fever  as he believed had saved his life   these were claims which he did not learn to overlook  though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax  before his own return to england put any thing in his power  when he did return  he sought out the child and took notice of her  he was a married man  with only one living child  a girl  about jane  age   and jane became their guest  paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all  and before she was nine years old  his daughter  great fondness for her  and his own wish of being a real friend  united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education   it was accepted  and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell  family  and had lived with them entirely  only visiting her grandmother from time to time   the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others  the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible   to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell  power  for though his income  by pay and appointments  was handsome  his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter   but  by giving her an education  he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter   such was jane fairfax  history   she had fallen into good hands  known nothing but kindness from the campbells  and been given an excellent education   living constantly with right minded and well informed people  her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture  and colonel campbell  residence being in london  every lighter talent had been done full justice to  by the attendance of first rate masters  her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do  and at eighteen or nineteen she was  as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children  fully competent to the office of instruction herself  but she was too much beloved to be parted with   neither father nor mother could promote  and the daughter could not endure it   the evil day was put off   it was easy to decide that she was still too young  and jane remained with them  sharing  as another daughter  in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society  and a judicious mixture of home and amusement  with only the drawback of the future  the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over   the affection of the whole family  the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular  was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane  decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements   that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman  nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents   they continued together with unabated regard however  till the marriage of miss campbell  who by that chance  that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs  giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior  engaged the affections of mr  dixon  a young man  rich and agreeable  almost as soon as they were acquainted  and was eligibly and happily settled  while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn   this event had very lately taken place  too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning   she had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period   with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate  she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice  and retire from all the pleasures of life  of rational intercourse  equal society  peace and hope  to penance and mortification for ever   the good sense of colonel and mrs  campbell could not oppose such a resolution  though their feelings did   as long as they lived  no exertions would be necessary  their home might be hers for ever  and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly  but this would be selfishness   what must be at last  had better be soon   perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay  and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished   still  however  affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment  she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter  marriage  and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength  they must forbid her engaging in duties  which  so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits  seemed  under the most favourable circumstances  to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort   with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland  her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth  though there might be some truths not told   it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury  to spend  perhaps  her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear  and the campbells  whatever might be their motive or motives  whether single  or double  or treble  gave the arrangement their ready sanction  and said  that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air  for the recovery of her health  than on any thing else   certain it was that she was to come  and that highbury  instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it  mr  frank churchill  must put up for the present with jane fairfax  who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence   emma was sorry   to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!  to be always doing more than she wished  and less than she ought!  why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer  mr  knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman  which she wanted to be thought herself  and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time  there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her   but  she could never get acquainted with her  she did not know how it was  but there was such coldness and reserve   such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not  and then  her aunt was such an eternal talker!  and she was made such a fuss with by every body!  and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate  because their ages were the same  every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other    these were her reasons   she had no better   it was a dislike so little just  every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy  that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence  without feeling that she had injured her  and now  when the due visit was paid  on her arrival  after a two years' interval  she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners  which for those two whole years she had been depreciating  jane fairfax was very elegant  remarkably elegant  and she had herself the highest value for elegance   her height was pretty  just such as almost every body would think tall  and nobody could think very tall  her figure particularly graceful  her size a most becoming medium  between fat and thin  though a slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two  emma could not but feel all this  and then  her face  her features   there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered  it was not regular  but it was very pleasing beauty   her eyes  a deep grey  with dark eye lashes and eyebrows  had never been denied their praise  but the skin  which she had been used to cavil at  as wanting colour  had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom   it was a style of beauty  of which elegance was the reigning character  and as such  she must  in honour  by all her principles  admire it   elegance  which  whether of person or of mind  she saw so little in highbury   there  not to be vulgar  was distinction  and merit   in short  she sat  during the first visit  looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency  the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice  and was determining that she would dislike her no longer   when she took in her history  indeed  her situation  as well as her beauty  when she considered what all this elegance was destined to  what she was going to sink from  how she was going to live  it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect  especially  if to every well known particular entitling her to interest  were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr  dixon  which she had so naturally started to herself   in that case  nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on  emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr  dixon  actions from his wife  or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first   if it were love  it might be simple  single  successless love on her side alone  she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison  while a sharer of his conversation with her friend  and from the best  the purest of motives  might now be denying herself this visit to ireland  and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty   upon the whole  emma left her with such softened  charitable feelings  as made her look around in walking home  and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence  nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her   these were charming feelings  but not lasting   before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax  or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors  than saying to mr  knightley   she certainly is handsome  she is better than handsome!   jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt  and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state   former provocations reappeared   the aunt was as tiresome as ever  more tiresome  because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers  and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast  and how small a slice of mutton for dinner  as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself  and jane  offences rose again   they had music  emma was obliged to play  and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour  an air of greatness  meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance   she was  besides  which was the worst of all  so cold  so cautious!  there was no getting at her real opinion  wrapt up in a cloak of politeness  she seemed determined to hazard nothing   she was disgustingly  was suspiciously reserved   if any thing could be more  where all was most  she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing  she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr  dixon  character  or her own value for his company  or opinion of the suitableness of the match   it was all general approbation and smoothness  nothing delineated or distinguished   it did her no service however  her caution was thrown away   emma saw its artifice  and returned to her first surmises   there probably  was  something more to conceal than her own preference  mr  dixon  perhaps  had been very near changing one friend for the other  or been fixed only to miss campbell  for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds   the like reserve prevailed on other topics   she and mr  frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time   it was known that they were a little acquainted  but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was    was he handsome     she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man     was he agreeable      he was generally thought so     did he appear a sensible young man  a young man of information     at a watering place  or in a common london acquaintance  it was difficult to decide on such points  manners were all that could be safely judged of  under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr  churchill   she believed every body found his manners pleasing    emma could not forgive her     chapter iii   emma could not forgive her   but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr  knightley  who had been of the party  and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side  he was expressing the next morning  being at hartfield again on business with mr  woodhouse  his approbation of the whole  not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room  but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma  he had been used to think her unjust to jane  and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement    a very pleasant evening   he began  as soon as mr  woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary  told that he understood  and the papers swept away    particularly pleasant   you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music   i do not know a more luxurious state  sir  than sitting at one  ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women  sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation   i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant  emma   you left nothing undone  i was glad you made her play so much  for having no instrument at her grandmother   it must have been a real indulgence     i am happy you approved   said emma  smiling   but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield     no  my dear   said her father instantly    that  i am sure you are not   there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are  if any thing  you are too attentive   the muffin last night  if it had been handed round once  i think it would have been enough     no   said mr  knightley  nearly at the same time   you are not often deficient  not often deficient either in manner or comprehension  i think you understand me  therefore    an arch look expressed   i understand you well enough   but she said only   miss fairfax is reserved     i always told you she was  a little  but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome  all that has its foundation in diffidence   what arises from discretion must be honoured     you think her diffident   i do not see it     my dear emma   said he  moving from his chair into one close by her   you are not going to tell me  i hope  that you had not a pleasant evening     oh! no  i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions  and amused to think how little information i obtained     i am disappointed   was his only answer    i hope every body had a pleasant evening   said mr  woodhouse  in his quiet way    i had   once  i felt the fire rather too much  but then i moved back my chair a little  a very little  and it did not disturb me   miss bates was very chatty and good humoured  as she always is  though she speaks rather too quick   however  she is very agreeable  and mrs  bates too  in a different way  i like old friends  and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady  a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed  she must have found the evening agreeable  mr  knightley  because she had emma     true  sir  and emma  because she had miss fairfax    emma saw his anxiety  and wishing to appease it  at least for the present  said  and with a sincerity which no one could question     she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one  eyes from  i am always watching her to admire  and i do pity her from my heart    mr  knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express  and before he could make any reply  mr  woodhouse  whose thoughts were on the bates   said     it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and i have often wished  but it is so little one can venture to do  small  trifling presents  of any thing uncommon   now we have killed a porker  and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg  it is very small and delicate  hartfield pork is not like any other pork  but still it is pork  and  my dear emma  unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks  nicely fried  as ours are fried  without the smallest grease  and not roast it  for no stomach can bear roast pork  i think we had better send the leg   do not you think so  my dear     my dear papa  i sent the whole hind quarter  i knew you would wish it  there will be the leg to be salted  you know  which is so very nice  and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like     that  right  my dear  very right   i had not thought of it before  but that is the best way   they must not over salt the leg  and then  if it is not over salted  and if it is very thoroughly boiled  just as serle boils ours  and eaten very moderately of  with a boiled turnip  and a little carrot or parsnip  i do not consider it unwholesome     emma   said mr  knightley presently   i have a piece of news for you  you like news  and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you     news!  oh! yes  i always like news   what is it   why do you smile so   where did you hear it   at randalls    he had time only to say    no  not at randalls  i have not been near randalls   when the door was thrown open  and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room  full of thanks  and full of news  miss bates knew not which to give quickest   mr  knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment  and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him    oh! my dear sir  how are you this morning   my dear miss woodhouse   i come quite over powered  such a beautiful hind quarter of pork! you are too bountiful!  have you heard the news   mr  elton is going to be married    emma had not had time even to think of mr  elton  and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start  and a little blush  at the sound    there is my news   i thought it would interest you   said mr  knightley  with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them    but where could  you  hear it   cried miss bates    where could you possibly hear it  mr  knightley   for it is not five minutes since i received mrs  cole  note  no  it cannot be more than five   or at least ten  for i had got my bonnet and spencer on  just ready to come out  i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork  jane was standing in the passage  were not you  jane    for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough   so i said i would go down and see  and jane said  `shall i go down instead  for i think you have a little cold  and patty has been washing the kitchen '  `oh! my dear ' said i  well  and just then came the note   a miss hawkins   that  all i know   a miss hawkins of bath   but  mr  knightley  how could you possibly have heard it  for the very moment mr  cole told mrs  cole of it  she sat down and wrote to me   a miss hawkins      i was with mr  cole on business an hour and a half ago  he had just read elton  letter as i was shewn in  and handed it to me directly     well! that is quite  i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting   my dear sir  you really are too bountiful  my mother desires her very best compliments and regards  and a thousand thanks  and says you really quite oppress her     we consider our hartfield pork   replied mr  woodhouse   indeed it certainly is  so very superior to all other pork  that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than      oh! my dear sir  as my mother says  our friends are only too good to us   if ever there were people who  without having great wealth themselves  had every thing they could wish for  i am sure it is us  we may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage ' well  mr  knightley  and so you actually saw the letter  well      it was short  merely to announce  but cheerful  exulting  of course     here was a sly glance at emma    he had been so fortunate as to   i forget the precise words  one has no business to remember them  the information was  as you state  that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins   by his style  i should imagine it just settled     mr  elton going to be married!  said emma  as soon as she could speak   he will have every body  wishes for his happiness     he is very young to settle   was mr  woodhouse  observation   he had better not be in a hurry   he seemed to me very well off as he was   we were always glad to see him at hartfield     a new neighbour for us all  miss woodhouse!  said miss bates  joyfully   my mother is so pleased!  she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress  this is great news  indeed   jane  you have never seen mr  elton!  no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him    jane  curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her    no  i have never seen mr  elton   she replied  starting on this appeal   is he  is he a tall man     who shall answer that question   cried emma    my father would say `yes ' mr  knightley `no ' and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium   when you have been here a little longer  miss fairfax  you will understand that mr  elton is the standard of perfection in highbury  both in person and mind     very true  miss woodhouse  so she will   he is the very best young man  but  my dear jane  if you remember  i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr  perry   miss hawkins   i dare say  an excellent young woman   his extreme attention to my mother   wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew  that she might hear the better  for my mother is a little deaf  you know  it is not much  but she does not hear quite quick   jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf   he fancied bathing might be good for it  the warm bath   but she says it did him no lasting benefit   colonel campbell  you know  is quite our angel   and mr  dixon seems a very charming young man  quite worthy of him   it is such a happiness when good people get together  and they always do   now  here will be mr  elton and miss hawkins  and there are the coles  such very good people  and the perrys  i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr  and mrs  perry   i say  sir   turning to mr  woodhouse   i think there are few places with such society as highbury  i always say  we are quite blessed in our neighbours   my dear sir  if there is one thing my mother loves better than another  it is pork   a roast loin of pork      as to who  or what miss hawkins is  or how long he has been acquainted with her   said emma   nothing i suppose can be known  one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance   he has been gone only four weeks    nobody had any information to give  and  after a few more wonderings  emma said    you are silent  miss fairfax  but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news   you  who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects  who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell  account  we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr  elton and miss hawkins     when i have seen mr  elton   replied jane   i dare say i shall be interested  but i believe it requires  that  with me  and as it is some months since miss campbell married  the impression may be a little worn off     yes  he has been gone just four weeks  as you observe  miss woodhouse   said miss bates   four weeks yesterday   a miss hawkins!  well  i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts  not that i ever  mrs  cole once whispered to me  but i immediately said  `no  mr  elton is a most worthy young man  but'  in short  i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries  i do not pretend to it   what is before me  i see   at the same time  nobody could wonder if mr  elton should have aspired  miss woodhouse lets me chatter on  so good humouredly  she knows i would not offend for the world   how does miss smith do   she seems quite recovered now   have you heard from mrs  john knightley lately  oh! those dear little children   jane  do you know i always fancy mr  dixon like mr  john knightley   i mean in person  tall  and with that sort of look  and not very talkative     quite wrong  my dear aunt  there is no likeness at all     very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand  one takes up a notion  and runs away with it   mr  dixon  you say  is not  strictly speaking  handsome     handsome!  oh! no  far from it  certainly plain   i told you he was plain     my dear  you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain  and that you yourself      oh! as for me  my judgment is worth nothing   where i have a regard  i always think a person well looking  but i gave what i believed the general opinion  when i called him plain     well  my dear jane  i believe we must be running away  the weather does not look well  and grandmama will be uneasy  you are too obliging  my dear miss woodhouse  but we really must take leave   this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed  i shall just go round by mrs  cole   but i shall not stop three minutes  and  jane  you had better go home directly  i would not have you out in a shower!  we think she is the better for highbury already  thank you  we do indeed   i shall not attempt calling on mrs  goddard  for i really do not think she cares for any thing but  boiled  pork  when we dress the leg it will be another thing   good morning to you  my dear sir   oh!  mr  knightley is coming too   well  that is so very!  i am sure if jane is tired  you will be so kind as to give her your arm   mr  elton  and miss hawkins!  good morning to you    emma  alone with her father  had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry   and to marry strangers too  and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject   it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news  as proving that mr  elton could not have suffered long  but she was sorry for harriet  harriet must feel it  and all that she could hope was  by giving the first information herself  to save her from hearing it abruptly from others   it was now about the time that she was likely to call  if she were to meet miss bates in her way!  and upon its beginning to rain  emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs  goddard   and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation   the shower was heavy  but short  and it had not been over five minutes  when in came harriet  with just the heated  agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give  and the  oh! miss woodhouse  what do you think has happened!  which instantly burst forth  had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation  as the blow was given  emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening  and harriet  unchecked  ran eagerly through what she had to tell    she had set out from mrs  goddard  half an hour ago  she had been afraid it would rain  she had been afraid it would pour down every moment  but she thought she might get to hartfield first  she had hurried on as fast as possible  but then  as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her  she thought she would just step in and see how it went on  and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there  soon after she came out it began to rain  and she did not know what to do  so she ran on directly  as fast as she could  and took shelter at ford     ford  was the principal woollen draper  linen draper  and haberdasher  shop united  the shop first in size and fashion in the place    and so  there she had set  without an idea of any thing in the world  full ten minutes  perhaps  when  all of a sudden  who should come in   to be sure it was so very odd!  but they always dealt at ford    who should come in  but elizabeth martin and her brother!   dear miss woodhouse! only think   i thought i should have fainted  i did not know what to do   i was sitting near the door  elizabeth saw me directly  but he did not  he was busy with the umbrella  i am sure she saw me  but she looked away directly  and took no notice  and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop  and i kept sitting near the door!  oh! dear  i was so miserable! i am sure i must have been as white as my gown   i could not go away you know  because of the rain  but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there   oh! dear  miss woodhouse  well  at last  i fancy  he looked round and saw me  for instead of going on with her buyings  they began whispering to one another  i am sure they were talking of me  and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me   do you think he was  miss woodhouse    for presently she came forward  came quite up to me  and asked me how i did  and seemed ready to shake hands  if i would   she did not do any of it in the same way that she used  i could see she was altered  but  however  she seemed to  try  to be very friendly  and we shook hands  and stood talking some time  but i know no more what i said  i was in such a tremble!  i remember she said she was sorry we never met now  which i thought almost too kind!  dear  miss woodhouse  i was absolutely miserable! by that time  it was beginning to hold up  and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away  and then  only think!   i found he was coming up towards me too  slowly you know  and as if he did not quite know what to do  and so he came and spoke  and i answered  and i stood for a minute  feeling dreadfully  you know  one can't tell how  and then i took courage  and said it did not rain  and i must go  and so off i set  and i had not got three yards from the door  when he came after me  only to say  if i was going to hartfield  he thought i had much better go round by mr  cole  stables  for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain   oh! dear  i thought it would have been the death of me! so i said  i was very much obliged to him   you know i could not do less  and then he went back to elizabeth  and i came round by the stables  i believe i did  but i hardly knew where i was  or any thing about it   oh!  miss woodhouse  i would rather done any thing than have it happen   and yet  you know  there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly  and elizabeth  too   oh!  miss woodhouse  do talk to me and make me comfortable again    very sincerely did emma wish to do so  but it was not immediately in her power   she was obliged to stop and think   she was not thoroughly comfortable herself   the young man  conduct  and his sister   seemed the result of real feeling  and she could not but pity them  as harriet described it  there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour  but she had believed them to be well meaning  worthy people before  and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion  it was folly to be disturbed by it   of course  he must be sorry to lose her  they must be all sorry   ambition  as well as love  had probably been mortified   they might all have hoped to rise by harriet  acquaintance   and besides  what was the value of harriet  description   so easily pleased  so little discerning    what signified her praise   she exerted herself  and did try to make her comfortable  by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle  and quite unworthy of being dwelt on    it might be distressing  for the moment   said she   but you seem to have behaved extremely well  and it is over  and may never   can never  as a first meeting  occur again  and therefore you need not think about it    harriet said   very true   and she  would not think about it   but still she talked of it  still she could talk of nothing else  and emma  at last  in order to put the martins out of her head  was obliged to hurry on the news  which she had meant to give with so much tender caution  hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry  ashamed or only amused  at such a state of mind in poor harriet  such a conclusion of mr  elton  importance with her!  mr  elton  rights  however  gradually revived   though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before  or an hour before  its interest soon increased  and before their first conversation was over  she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity  wonder and regret  pain and pleasure  as to this fortunate miss hawkins  which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy   emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting  it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock  without retaining any influence to alarm   as harriet now lived  the martins could not get at her  without seeking her  where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her  for since her refusal of the brother  the sisters never had been at mrs  goddard   and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again  with any necessity  or even any power of speech     chapter iv   human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations  that a young person  who either marries or dies  is sure of being kindly spoken of   a week had not passed since miss hawkins  name was first mentioned in highbury  before she was  by some means or other  discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind  to be handsome  elegant  highly accomplished  and perfectly amiable  and when mr  elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects  and circulate the fame of her merits  there was very little more for him to do  than to tell her christian name  and say whose music she principally played   mr  elton returned  a very happy man   he had gone away rejected and mortified  disappointed in a very sanguine hope  after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement  and not only losing the right lady  but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one   he had gone away deeply offended  he came back engaged to another  and to another as superior  of course  to the first  as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost  he came back gay and self satisfied  eager and busy  caring nothing for miss woodhouse  and defying miss smith   the charming augusta hawkins  in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit  was in possession of an independent fortune  of so many thousands as would always be called ten  a point of some dignity  as well as some convenience   the story told well  he had not thrown himself away  he had gained a woman of 10 000 l  or thereabouts  and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity   the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice  the history which he had to give mrs  cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious  the steps so quick  from the accidental rencontre  to the dinner at mr  green   and the party at mrs  brown   smiles and blushes rising in importance   with consciousness and agitation richly scattered  the lady had been so easily impressed  so sweetly disposed  had in short  to use a most intelligible phrase  been so very ready to have him  that vanity and prudence were equally contented   he had caught both substance and shadow  both fortune and affection  and was just the happy man he ought to be  talking only of himself and his own concerns  expecting to be congratulated  ready to be laughed at  and  with cordial  fearless smiles  now addressing all the young ladies of the place  to whom  a few weeks ago  he would have been more cautiously gallant   the wedding was no distant event  as the parties had only themselves to please  and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for  and when he set out for bath again  there was a general expectation  which a certain glance of mrs  cole  did not seem to contradict  that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride   during his present short stay  emma had barely seen him  but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over  and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension  now spread over his air   she was  in fact  beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all  and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings  that  except in a moral light  as a penance  a lesson  a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind  she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again  she wished him very well  but he gave her pain  and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction   the pain of his continued residence in highbury  however  must certainly be lessened by his marriage   many vain solicitudes would be prevented   many awkwardnesses smoothed by it   a  mrs    elton  would be an excuse for any change of intercourse  former intimacy might sink without remark  it would be almost beginning their life of civility again   of the lady  individually  emma thought very little   she was good enough for mr  elton  no doubt  accomplished enough for highbury   handsome enough  to look plain  probably  by harriet  side  as to connexion  there emma was perfectly easy  persuaded  that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet  he had done nothing   on that article  truth seemed attainable   what  she was  must be uncertain  but  who  she was  might be found out  and setting aside the 10 000 l   it did not appear that she was at all harriet  superior   she brought no name  no blood  no alliance  miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol   merchant  of course  he must be called  but  as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate  it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also   part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath  but bristol was her home  the very heart of bristol  for though the father and mother had died some years ago  an uncle remained   in the law line  nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him  than that he was in the law line  and with him the daughter had lived   emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney  and too stupid to rise   and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister  who was  very   well   married   to a gentleman in a  great   way   near bristol  who kept two carriages! that was the wind up of the history  that was the glory of miss hawkins   could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all! she had talked her into love  but  alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it   the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet  mind was not to be talked away   he might be superseded by another  he certainly would indeed  nothing could be clearer  even a robert martin would have been sufficient  but nothing else  she feared  would cure her   harriet was one of those  who  having once begun  would be always in love   and now  poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr  elton  she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other   emma saw him only once  but two or three times every day harriet was sure  just  to meet with him  or  just  to miss him   just  to hear his voice  or see his shoulder   just  to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy  in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture  she was  moreover  perpetually hearing about him  for  excepting when at hartfield  she was always among those who saw no fault in mr  elton  and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns  and every report  therefore  every guess  all that had already occurred  all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs  comprehending income  servants  and furniture  was continually in agitation around her   her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him  and her regrets kept alive  and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins  happiness  and continual observation of  how much he seemed attached!   his air as he walked by the house  the very sitting of his hat  being all in proof of how much he was in love!  had it been allowable entertainment  had there been no pain to her friend  or reproach to herself  in the waverings of harriet  mind  emma would have been amused by its variations  sometimes mr  elton predominated  sometimes the martins  and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other   mr  elton  engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr  martin  the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin  calling at mrs  goddard  a few days afterwards   harriet had not been at home  but a note had been prepared and left for her  written in the very style to touch  a small mixture of reproach  with a great deal of kindness  and till mr  elton himself appeared  she had been much occupied by it  continually pondering over what could be done in return  and wishing to do more than she dared to confess   but mr  elton  in person  had driven away all such cares   while he staid  the martins were forgotten  and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again  emma  to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned  judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin  visit   how that visit was to be acknowledged  what would be necessary   and what might be safest  had been a point of some doubtful consideration   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters  when invited to come  would be ingratitude   it must not be  and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!    after much thinking  she could determine on nothing better  than harriet  returning the visit  but in a way that  if they had understanding  should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance  she meant to take her in the carriage  leave her at the abbey mill  while she drove a little farther  and call for her again so soon  as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past  and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future   she could think of nothing better   and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve  something of ingratitude  merely glossed over  it must be done  or what would become of harriet     chapter v   small heart had harriet for visiting   only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs  goddard   her evil stars had led her to the very spot where  at that moment  a trunk  directed to  the   rev    philip   elton    white hart    bath   was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher  cart  which was to convey it to where the coaches past  and every thing in this world  excepting that trunk and the direction  was consequently a blank   she went  however  and when they reached the farm  and she was to be put down  at the end of the broad  neat gravel walk  which led between espalier apple trees to the front door  the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before  was beginning to revive a little local agitation  and when they parted  emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity  which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour   she went on herself  to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married  and settled in donwell   the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again  and miss smith receiving her summons  was with her without delay  and unattended by any alarming young man   she came solitarily down the gravel walk  a miss martin just appearing at the door  and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility   harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account  she was feeling too much  but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting  and the sort of pain it was creating   she had seen only mrs  martin and the two girls  they had received her doubtingly  if not coolly  and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time   till just at last  when mrs  martin  saying  all of a sudden  that she thought miss smith was grown  had brought on a more interesting subject  and a warmer manner   in that very room she had been measured last september  with her two friends  there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window    he  had done it   they all seemed to remember the day  the hour  the party  the occasion  to feel the same consciousness  the same regrets  to be ready to return to the same good understanding  and they were just growing again like themselves   harriet  as emma must suspect  as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy   when the carriage reappeared  and all was over   the style of the visit  and the shortness of it  were then felt to be decisive  fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!  emma could not but picture it all  and feel how justly they might resent  how naturally harriet must suffer   it was a bad business   she would have given a great deal  or endured a great deal  to have had the martins in a higher rank of life   they were so deserving  that a  little  higher should have been enough   but as it was  how could she have done otherwise   impossible!  she could not repent   they must be separated  but there was a great deal of pain in the process   so much to herself at this time  that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation  and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it   her mind was quite sick of mr  elton and the martins  the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary   it was a good scheme  but on driving to the door they heard that neither  master nor mistress was at home   they had both been out some time  the man believed they were gone to hartfield    this is too bad   cried emma  as they turned away    and now we shall just miss them  too provoking!  i do not know when i have been so disappointed    and she leaned back in the corner  to indulge her murmurs  or to reason them away  probably a little of both   such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind  presently the carriage stopt  she looked up  it was stopt by mr  and mrs  weston  who were standing to speak to her  there was instant pleasure in the sight of them  and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound  for mr  weston immediately accosted her with    how d'ye do   how d'ye do   we have been sitting with your father   glad to see him so well   frank comes to morrow  i had a letter this morning  we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty   he is at oxford to day  and he comes for a whole fortnight  i knew it would be so   if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days  i was always glad he did not come at christmas  now we are going to have just the right weather for him  fine  dry  settled weather  we shall enjoy him completely  every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish    there was no resisting such news  no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr  weston   confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife  fewer and quieter  but not less to the purpose   to know that  she  thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so  and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy   it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits   the worn out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming  and in the rapidity of half a moment  thought  she hoped mr  elton would now be talked of no more   mr  weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe  which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command  as well as the route and the method of his journey  and she listened  and smiled  and congratulated    i shall soon bring him over to hartfield   said he  at the conclusion   emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech  from his wife    we had better move on  mr  weston   said she   we are detaining the girls     well  well  i am ready    and turning again to emma   but you must not be expecting such a  very  fine young man  you have only had  my  account you know  i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary     though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction   emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent  and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing    think of me to morrow  my dear emma  about four o'clock   was mrs  weston  parting injunction  spoken with some anxiety  and meant only for her    four o'clock!  depend upon it he will be here by three   was mr  weston  quick amendment  and so ended a most satisfactory meeting  emma  spirits were mounted quite up to happiness  every thing wore a different air  james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before   when she looked at the hedges  she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out  and when she turned round to harriet  she saw something like a look of spring  a tender smile even there    will mr  frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford     was a question  however  which did not augur much   but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once  and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time   the morning of the interesting day arrived  and mrs  weston  faithful pupil did not forget either at ten  or eleven  or twelve o'clock  that she was to think of her at four    my dear  dear anxious friend    said she  in mental soliloquy  while walking downstairs from her own room   always overcareful for every body  comfort but your own  i see you now in all your little fidgets  going again and again into his room  to be sure that all is right    the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall    'tis twelve  i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence  and by this time to morrow  perhaps  or a little later  i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here  i am sure they will bring him soon    she opened the parlour door  and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father  mr  weston and his son   they had been arrived only a few minutes  and mr  weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank  being a day before his time  and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations  when she appeared  to have her share of surprize  introduction  and pleasure   the frank churchill so long talked of  so high in interest  was actually before her  he was presented to her  and she did not think too much had been said in his praise  he was a  very  good looking young man  height  air  address  all were unexceptionable  and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father   he looked quick and sensible   she felt immediately that she should like him  and there was a well bred ease of manner  and a readiness to talk  which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her  and that acquainted they soon must be   he had reached randalls the evening before   she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan  and travel earlier  later  and quicker  that he might gain half a day    i told you yesterday   cried mr  weston with exultation   i told you all that he would be here before the time named   i remembered what i used to do myself   one cannot creep upon a journey  one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned  and the pleasure of coming in upon one  friends before the look out begins  is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs     it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it   said the young man   though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far  but in coming  home  i felt i might do any thing    the word  home  made his father look on him with fresh complacency  emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable  the conviction was strengthened by what followed   he was very much pleased with randalls  thought it a most admirably arranged house  would hardly allow it even to be very small  admired the situation  the walk to highbury  highbury itself  hartfield still more  and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one   own  country gives  and the greatest curiosity to visit it   that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before  passed suspiciously through emma  brain  but still  if it were a falsehood  it was a pleasant one  and pleasantly handled   his manner had no air of study or exaggeration   he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment   their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance  on his side were the inquiries    was she a horsewoman   pleasant rides    pleasant walks   had they a large neighbourhood   highbury  perhaps  afforded society enough   there were several very pretty houses in and about it   balls  had they balls   was it a musical society    but when satisfied on all these points  and their acquaintance proportionably advanced  he contrived to find an opportunity  while their two fathers were engaged with each other  of introducing his mother in law  and speaking of her with so much handsome praise  so much warm admiration  so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father  and her very kind reception of himself  as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please   and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her  he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs  weston  but  undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter   he understood what would be welcome  he could be sure of little else    his father  marriage   he said   had been the wisest measure  every friend must rejoice in it  and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him    he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor  merits  without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse  character  than miss woodhouse miss taylor   and at last  as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object  he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person    elegant  agreeable manners  i was prepared for   said he   but i confess that  considering every thing  i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age  i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs  weston     you cannot see too much perfection in mrs  weston for my feelings   said emma   were you to guess her to be  eighteen   i should listen with pleasure  but  she  would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words   don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman     i hope i should know better   he replied   no  depend upon it   with a gallant bow   that in addressing mrs  weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms    emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other  which had taken strong possession of her mind  had ever crossed his  and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence  or proofs of defiance  she must see more of him to understand his ways  at present she only felt they were agreeable   she had no doubt of what mr  weston was often thinking about  his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression  and even  when he might have determined not to look  she was confident that he was often listening   her own father  perfect exemption from any thought of the kind  the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion  was a most comfortable circumstance   happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it    though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged  he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any  it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them   she blessed the favouring blindness  he could now  without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise  without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest  give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr  frank churchill  accommodation on his journey  through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road  and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold  which  however  he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night   a reasonable visit paid  mr  weston began to move    he must be going  he had business at the crown about his hay  and a great many errands for mrs  weston at ford   but he need not hurry any body else   his son  too well bred to hear the hint  rose immediately also  saying    as you are going farther on business  sir  i will take the opportunity of paying a visit  which must be paid some day or other  and therefore may as well be paid now   i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours   turning to emma   a lady residing in or near highbury  a family of the name of fairfax  i shall have no difficulty  i suppose  in finding the house  though fairfax  i believe  is not the proper name  i should rather say barnes  or bates   do you know any family of that name     to be sure we do   cried his father   mrs  bates  we passed her house   i saw miss bates at the window   true  true  you are acquainted with miss fairfax  i remember you knew her at weymouth  and a fine girl she is   call upon her  by all means     there is no necessity for my calling this morning   said the young man   another day would do as well  but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which      oh! go to day  go to day  do not defer it   what is right to be done cannot be done too soon   and  besides  i must give you a hint  frank  any want of attention to her  here  should be carefully avoided  you saw her with the campbells  when she was the equal of every body she mixed with  but here she is with a poor old grandmother  who has barely enough to live on   if you do not call early it will be a slight    the son looked convinced    i have heard her speak of the acquaintance   said emma   she is a very elegant young woman    he agreed to it  but with so quiet a  yes   as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence  and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world  if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it    if you were never particularly struck by her manners before   said she   i think you will to day  you will see her to advantage  see her and hear her  no  i am afraid you will not hear her at all  for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue     you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax  sir  are you   said mr  woodhouse  always the last to make his way in conversation   then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady   she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt  very worthy people  i have known them all my life  they will be extremely glad to see you  i am sure  and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way     my dear sir  upon no account in the world  my father can direct me     but your father is not going so far  he is only going to the crown  quite on the other side of the street  and there are a great many houses  you might be very much at a loss  and it is a very dirty walk  unless you keep on the footpath  but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street    mr  frank churchill still declined it  looking as serious as he could  and his father gave his hearty support by calling out   my good friend  this is quite unnecessary  frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it  and as to mrs  bates   he may get there from the crown in a hop  step  and jump    they were permitted to go alone  and with a cordial nod from one  and a graceful bow from the other  the two gentlemen took leave  emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance  and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day  with full confidence in their comfort     chapter vi   the next morning brought mr  frank churchill again   he came with mrs  weston  to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially  he had been sitting with her  it appeared  most companionably at home  till her usual hour of exercise  and on being desired to chuse their walk  immediately fixed on highbury    he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction  but if left to him  he should always chuse the same   highbury  that airy  cheerful  happy looking highbury  would be his constant attraction     highbury  with mrs  weston  stood for hartfield  and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him   they walked thither directly   emma had hardly expected them   for mr  weston  who had called in for half a minute  in order to hear that his son was very handsome  knew nothing of their plans  and it was an agreeable surprize to her  therefore  to perceive them walking up to the house together  arm in arm   she was wanting to see him again  and especially to see him in company with mrs  weston  upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend   if he were deficient there  nothing should make amends for it   but on seeing them together  she became perfectly satisfied   it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty  nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her  nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection   and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment  as their visit included all the rest of the morning  they were all three walking about together for an hour or two   first round the shrubberies of hartfield  and afterwards in highbury  he was delighted with every thing  admired hartfield sufficiently for mr  woodhouse  ear  and when their going farther was resolved on  confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village  and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed   some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings  he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long  and which had been the home of his father  father  and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living  walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other  and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit  they shewed  altogether  a good will towards highbury in general  which must be very like a merit to those he was with   emma watched and decided  that with such feelings as were now shewn  it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself  that he had not been acting a part  or making a parade of insincere professions  and that mr  knightley certainly had not done him justice   their first pause was at the crown inn  an inconsiderable house  though the principal one of the sort  where a couple of pair of post horses were kept  more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road  and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there  but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added  it had been built many years ago for a ball room  and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous  dancing state  had been occasionally used as such   but such brilliant days had long passed away  and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place  he was immediately interested   its character as a ball room caught him  and instead of passing on  he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open  to look in and contemplate its capabilities  and lament that its original purpose should have ceased   he saw no fault in the room  he would acknowledge none which they suggested   no  it was long enough  broad enough  handsome enough   it would hold the very number for comfort  they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter   why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room   she who could do any thing in highbury! the want of proper families in the place  and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend  were mentioned  but he was not satisfied  he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw around him  could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting  and even when particulars were given and families described  he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing  or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body  returning into their proper place the next morning  he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing  and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills   he seemed to have all the life and spirit  cheerful feelings  and social inclinations of his father  and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe  of pride  indeed  there was  perhaps  scarcely enough  his indifference to a confusion of rank  bordered too much on inelegance of mind  he could be no judge  however  of the evil he was holding cheap  it was but an effusion of lively spirits   at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown  and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged  emma recollected his intended visit the day before  and asked him if he had paid it    yes  oh! yes   he replied   i was just going to mention it  a very successful visit   i saw all the three ladies  and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint   if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize  it must have been the death of me  as it was  i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit  ten minutes would have been all that was necessary  perhaps all that was proper  and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him  but there was no getting away  no pause  and  to my utter astonishment  i found  when he  finding me nowhere else  joined me there at last  that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour   the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before     and how did you think miss fairfax looking     ill  very ill  that is  if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill  but the expression is hardly admissible  mrs  weston  is it  ladies can never look ill   and  seriously  miss fairfax is naturally so pale  as almost always to give the appearance of ill health    a most deplorable want of complexion    emma would not agree to this  and began a warm defence of miss fairfax  complexion    it was certainly never brilliant  but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general  and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face    he listened with all due deference  acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same  but yet he must confess  that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health   where features were indifferent  a fine complexion gave beauty to them all  and where they were good  the effect was  fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was    well   said emma   there is no disputing about taste   at least you admire her except her complexion    he shook his head and laughed    i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion     did you see her often at weymouth   were you often in the same society    at this moment they were approaching ford   and he hastily exclaimed   ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives  as my father informs me   he comes to highbury himself  he says  six days out of the seven  and has always business at ford   if it be not inconvenient to you  pray let us go in  that i may prove myself to belong to the place  to be a true citizen of highbury  i must buy something at ford   it will be taking out my freedom    i dare say they sell gloves     oh! yes  gloves and every thing   i do admire your patriotism  you will be adored in highbury   you were very popular before you came  because you were mr  weston  son  but lay out half a guinea at ford   and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues    they went in  and while the sleek  well tied parcels of  men  beavers  and  york tan  were bringing down and displaying on the counter  he said   but i beg your pardon  miss woodhouse  you were speaking to me  you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my  amor   patriae    do not let me lose it   i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life     i merely asked  whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth     and now that i understand your question  i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one   it is always the lady  right to decide on the degree of acquaintance   miss fairfax must already have given her account    i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow     upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself  but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed  she is so very reserved  so very unwilling to give the least information about any body  that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her     may i  indeed   then i will speak the truth  and nothing suits me so well   i met her frequently at weymouth   i had known the campbells a little in town  and at weymouth we were very much in the same set  colonel campbell is a very agreeable man  and mrs  campbell a friendly  warm hearted woman   i like them all     you know miss fairfax  situation in life  i conclude  what she is destined to be     yes   rather hesitatingly   i believe i do     you get upon delicate subjects  emma   said mrs  weston smiling   remember that i am here   mr  frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax  situation in life  i will move a little farther off     i certainly do forget to think of  her    said emma   as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend    he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment   when the gloves were bought  and they had quitted the shop again   did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of  play   said frank churchill    ever hear her!  repeated emma    you forget how much she belongs to highbury   i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began   she plays charmingly     you think so  do you   i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge   she appeared to me to play well  that is  with considerable taste  but i know nothing of the matter myself    i am excessively fond of music  but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body  performance   i have been used to hear her  admired  and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well   a man  a very musical man  and in love with another woman  engaged to her  on the point of marriage   would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument  if the lady in question could sit down instead  never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other   that  i thought  in a man of known musical talent  was some proof     proof indeed!  said emma  highly amused    mr  dixon is very musical  is he   we shall know more about them all  in half an hour  from you  than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year     yes  mr  dixon and miss campbell were the persons  and i thought it a very strong proof     certainly  very strong it was  to own the truth  a great deal stronger than  if  i  had been miss campbell  would have been at all agreeable to me   i could not excuse a man  having more music than love  more ear than eye  a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings   how did miss campbell appear to like it     it was her very particular friend  you know     poor comfort!  said emma  laughing    one would rather have a stranger preferred than one  very particular friend  with a stranger it might not recur again  but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand  to do every thing better than one does oneself!   poor mrs  dixon!  well  i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland     you are right   it was not very flattering to miss campbell  but she really did not seem to feel it     so much the better  or so much the worse   i do not know which  but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her  quickness of friendship  or dulness of feeling  there was one person  i think  who must have felt it   miss fairfax herself   she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction     as to that  i do not      oh! do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax  sensations from you  or from any body else   they are known to no human being  i guess  but herself   but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr  dixon  one may guess what one chuses     there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all    he began rather quickly  but checking himself  added   however  it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were   how it might all be behind the scenes   i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly   but you  who have known miss fairfax from a child  must be a better judge of her character  and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations  than i can be     i have known her from a child  undoubtedly  we have been children and women together  and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate   that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends   but we never did   i hardly know how it has happened  a little  perhaps  from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was  by her aunt and grandmother  and all their set   and then  her reserve  i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved     it is a most repulsive quality  indeed   said he    oftentimes very convenient  no doubt  but never pleasing   there is safety in reserve  but no attraction   one cannot love a reserved person     not till the reserve ceases towards oneself  and then the attraction may be the greater   but i must be more in want of a friend  or an agreeable companion  than i have yet been  to take the trouble of conquering any body  reserve to procure one  intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question  i have no reason to think ill of her  not the least  except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner  such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body  is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal    he perfectly agreed with her   and after walking together so long  and thinking so much alike  emma felt herself so well acquainted with him  that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting  he was not exactly what she had expected  less of the man of the world in some of his notions  less of the spoiled child of fortune  therefore better than she had expected   his ideas seemed more moderate   his feelings warmer   she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr  elton  house  which  as well as the church  he would go and look at  and would not join them in finding much fault with   no  he could not believe it a bad house  not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having   if it were to be shared with the woman he loved  he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house   there must be ample room in it for every real comfort  the man must be a blockhead who wanted more   mrs  weston laughed  and said he did not know what he was talking about  used only to a large house himself  and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size  he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one  but emma  in her own mind  determined that he  did  know what he was talking about  and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life  and to marry  from worthy motives  he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper  room  or a bad butler  pantry  but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy  and that whenever he were attached  he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment     chapter vii   emma  very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day  by hearing that he was gone off to london  merely to have his hair cut   a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast  and he had sent for a chaise and set off  intending to return to dinner  but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut   there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand  but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve   it did not accord with the rationality of plan  the moderation in expense  or even the unselfish warmth of heart  which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday   vanity  extravagance  love of change  restlessness of temper  which must be doing something  good or bad  heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs  weston  indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general  he became liable to all these charges   his father only called him a coxcomb  and thought it a very good story  but that mrs  weston did not like it  was clear enough  by her passing it over as quickly as possible  and making no other comment than that  all young people would have their little whims    with the exception of this little blot  emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him   mrs  weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself  how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether  he appeared to have a very open temper  certainly a very cheerful and lively one  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions  a great deal decidedly right  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard  was fond of talking of him  said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself  and though there was no being attached to the aunt  he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude  and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect  this was all very promising  and  but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut  there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him  the honour  if not of being really in love with her  of being at least very near it  and saved only by her own indifference    for still her resolution held of never marrying   the honour  in short  of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance   mr  weston  on his side  added a virtue to the account which must have some weight   he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely  thought her very beautiful and very charming  and with so much to be said for him altogether  she found she must not judge him harshly   as mrs  weston observed   all young people would have their little whims    there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry  not so leniently disposed   in general he was judged  throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury  with great candour  liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man   one who smiled so often and bowed so well  but there was one spirit among them not to be softened  from its power of censure  by bows or smiles  mr  knightley   the circumstance was told him at hartfield  for the moment  he was silent  but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself  over a newspaper he held in his hand   hum! just the trifling  silly fellow i took him for    she had half a mind to resent  but an instant  observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings  and not meant to provoke  and therefore she let it pass   although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings  mr  and mrs  weston  visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune   something occurred while they were at hartfield  to make emma want their advice  and  which was still more lucky  she wanted exactly the advice they gave   this was the occurrence   the coles had been settled some years in highbury  and were very good sort of people  friendly  liberal  and unpretending  but  on the other hand  they were of low origin  in trade  and only moderately genteel   on their first coming into the country  they had lived in proportion to their income  quietly  keeping little company  and that little unexpensively  but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means   the house in town had yielded greater profits  and fortune in general had smiled on them   with their wealth  their views increased  their want of a larger house  their inclination for more company  they added to their house  to their number of servants  to their expenses of every sort  and by this time were  in fortune and style of living  second only to the family at hartfield  their love of society  and their new dining room  prepared every body for their keeping dinner company  and a few parties  chiefly among the single men  had already taken place   the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite   neither donwell  nor hartfield  nor randalls   nothing should tempt  her  to go  if they did  and she regretted that her father  known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish   the coles were very respectable in their way  but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them   this lesson  she very much feared  they would receive only from herself  she had little hope of mr  knightley  none of mr  weston   but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared  that when the insult came at last  it found her very differently affected   donwell and randalls had received their invitation  and none had come for her father and herself  and mrs  weston  accounting for it with  i suppose they will not take the liberty with you  they know you do not dine out   was not quite sufficient   she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal  and afterwards  as the idea of the party to be assembled there  consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her  occurred again and again  she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept  harriet was to be there in the evening  and the bateses   they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before  and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence  might not the evening end in a dance  had been a question of his  the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits  and her being left in solitary grandeur  even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment  was but poor comfort   it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield  which made their presence so acceptable  for though her first remark  on reading it  was that  of course it must be declined   she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do  that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful   she owned that  considering every thing  she was not absolutely without inclination for the party   the coles expressed themselves so properly  there was so much real attention in the manner of it   so much consideration for her father    they would have solicited the honour earlier  but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen from london  which they hoped might keep mr  woodhouse from any draught of air  and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company    upon the whole  she was very persuadable  and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort  how certainly mrs  goddard  if not mrs  bates  might be depended on for bearing him company   mr  woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter  going out to dinner on a day now near at hand  and spending the whole evening away from him   as for  his  going  emma did not wish him to think it possible  the hours would be too late  and the party too numerous   he was soon pretty well resigned    i am not fond of dinner visiting   said he   i never was  no more is emma   late hours do not agree with us   i am sorry mr  and mrs  cole should have done it   i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer  and take their tea with us  take us in their afternoon walk  which they might do  as our hours are so reasonable  and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening   the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to   however  as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them  and as you will both be there  and mr  knightley too  to take care of her  i cannot wish to prevent it  provided the weather be what it ought  neither damp  nor cold  nor windy    then turning to mrs  weston  with a look of gentle reproach   ah!  miss taylor  if you had not married  you would have staid at home with me     well  sir   cried mr  weston   as i took miss taylor away  it is incumbent on me to supply her place  if i can  and i will step to mrs  goddard in a moment  if you wish it    but the idea of any thing to be done in a  moment   was increasing  not lessening  mr  woodhouse  agitation   the ladies knew better how to allay it   mr  weston must be quiet  and every thing deliberately arranged   with this treatment  mr  woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual    he should be happy to see mrs  goddard  he had a great regard for mrs  goddard  and emma should write a line  and invite her   james could take the note   but first of all  there must be an answer written to mrs  cole     you will make my excuses  my dear  as civilly as possible   you will say that i am quite an invalid  and go no where  and therefore must decline their obliging invitation  beginning with my  compliments   of course   but you will do every thing right   i need not tell you what is to be done   we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday   i shall have no fears for you with him  we have never been there above once since the new approach was made  but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely  and when you get there  you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again  and you had better name an early hour  you will not like staying late   you will get very tired when tea is over     but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired  papa     oh! no  my love  but you will soon be tired   there will be a great many people talking at once   you will not like the noise     but  my dear sir   cried mr  weston   if emma comes away early  it will be breaking up the party     and no great harm if it does   said mr  woodhouse    the sooner every party breaks up  the better     but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles  emma  going away directly after tea might be giving offence  they are good natured people  and think little of their own claims  but still they must feel that any body  hurrying away is no great compliment  and miss woodhouse  doing it would be more thought of than any other person  in the room   you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles  i am sure  sir  friendly  good sort of people as ever lived  and who have been your neighbours these  ten  years     no  upon no account in the world  mr  weston  i am much obliged to you for reminding me   i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain   i know what worthy people they are   perry tells me that mr  cole never touches malt liquor   you would not think it to look at him  but he is bilious  mr  cole is very bilious  no  i would not be the means of giving them any pain   my dear emma  we must consider this   i am sure  rather than run the risk of hurting mr  and mrs  cole  you would stay a little longer than you might wish  you will not regard being tired   you will be perfectly safe  you know  among your friends     oh yes  papa   i have no fears at all for myself  and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs  weston  but on your account  i am only afraid of your sitting up for me   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs  goddard  she loves piquet  you know  but when she is gone home  i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself  instead of going to bed at your usual time  and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort  you must promise me not to sit up    he did  on the condition of some promises on her side   such as that  if she came home cold  she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly  if hungry  that she would take something to eat  that her own maid should sit up for her  and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house  as usual     chapter viii   frank churchill came back again  and if he kept his father  dinner waiting  it was not known at hartfield  for mrs  weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr  woodhouse  to betray any imperfection which could be concealed   he came back  had had his hair cut  and laughed at himself with a very good grace  but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done   he had no reason to wish his hair longer  to conceal any confusion of face  no reason to wish the money unspent  to improve his spirits   he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever  and  after seeing him  emma thus moralised to herself      i do not know whether it ought to be so  but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way   wickedness is always wickedness  but folly is not always folly   it depends upon the character of those who handle it  mr  knightley  he is  not  a trifling  silly young man   if he were  he would have done this differently   he would either have gloried in the achievement  or been ashamed of it   there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb  or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities   no  i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly    with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again  and for a longer time than hitherto  of judging of his general manners  and by inference  of the meaning of his manners towards herself  of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air  and of fancying what the observations of all those might be  who were now seeing them together for the first time   she meant to be very happy  in spite of the scene being laid at mr  cole   and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr  elton  even in the days of his favour  none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr  cole   her father  comfort was amply secured  mrs  bates as well as mrs  goddard being able to come  and her last pleasing duty  before she left the house  was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner  and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress  to make the two ladies all the amends in her power  by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine  for whatever unwilling self denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal   she had provided a plentiful dinner for them  she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it   she followed another carriage to mr  cole  door  and was pleased to see that it was mr  knightley   for mr  knightley keeping no horses  having little spare money and a great deal of health  activity  and independence  was too apt  in emma  opinion  to get about as he could  and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey   she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart  for he stopped to hand her out    this is coming as you should do   said she   like a gentleman    i am quite glad to see you    he thanked her  observing   how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! for  if we had met first in the drawing room  i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual    you might not have distinguished how i came  by my look or manner     yes i should  i am sure i should   there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them   you think you carry it off very well  i dare say  but with you it is a sort of bravado  an air of affected unconcern  i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances   now  you have nothing to try for   you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed   you are not striving to look taller than any body else    now  i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you     nonsensical girl!  was his reply  but not at all in anger   emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr  knightley   she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please  and given all the consequence she could wish for   when the westons arrived  the kindest looks of love  the strongest of admiration were for her  from both husband and wife  the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object  and at dinner she found him seated by her  and  as she firmly believed  not without some dexterity on his side   the party was rather large  as it included one other family  a proper unobjectionable country family  whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance  and the male part of mr  cox  family  the lawyer of highbury   the less worthy females were to come in the evening  with miss bates  miss fairfax  and miss smith  but already  at dinner  they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general  and  while politics and mr  elton were talked over  emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour   the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend  was the name of jane fairfax  mrs  cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting   she listened  and found it well worth listening to  that very dear part of emma  her fancy  received an amusing supply  mrs  cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates  and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte  a very elegant looking instrument  not a grand  but a large sized square pianoforte  and the substance of the story  the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize  and inquiry  and congratulations on her side  and explanations on miss bates   was  that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood  the day before  to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece  entirely unexpected  that at first  by miss bates  account  jane herself was quite at a loss  quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it   but now  they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter   of course it must be from colonel campbell    one can suppose nothing else   added mrs  cole   and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt   but jane  it seems  had a letter from them very lately  and not a word was said about it   she knows their ways best  but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present  they might chuse to surprize her    mrs  cole had many to agree with her  every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell  and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made  and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way  and still listen to mrs  cole    i declare  i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!  it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax  who plays so delightfully  should not have an instrument  it seemed quite a shame  especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away  this is like giving ourselves a slap  to be sure! and it was but yesterday i was telling mr  cole  i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room  while i do not know one note from another  and our little girls  who are but just beginning  perhaps may never make any thing of it  and there is poor jane fairfax  who is mistress of music  has not any thing of the nature of an instrument  not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world  to amuse herself with   i was saying this to mr  cole but yesterday  and he quite agreed with me  only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase  hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can  and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought   or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it   we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening    miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence  and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs  cole   turned to frank churchill    why do you smile   said she    nay  why do you     me!  i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell  being so rich and so liberal   it is a handsome present     very     i rather wonder that it was never made before     perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before     or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument   which must now be shut up in london  untouched by any body     that is a grand pianoforte  and he might think it too large for mrs  bates  house     you may  say  what you chuse  but your countenance testifies that your  thoughts  on this subject are very much like mine     i do not know   i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve   i smile because you smile  and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect  but at present i do not see what there is to question   if colonel campbell is not the person  who can be     what do you say to mrs  dixon     mrs  dixon! very true indeed   i had not thought of mrs  dixon  she must know as well as her father  how acceptable an instrument would be  and perhaps the mode of it  the mystery  the surprize  is more like a young woman  scheme than an elderly man   it is mrs  dixon  i dare say   i told you that your suspicions would guide mine     if so  you must extend your suspicions and comprehend  mr   dixon in them     mr  dixon   very well   yes  i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr  and mrs  dixon   we were speaking the other day  you know  of his being so warm an admirer of her performance     yes  and what you told me on that head  confirmed an idea which i had entertained before   i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr  dixon or miss fairfax  but i cannot help suspecting either that  after making his proposals to her friend  he had the misfortune to fall in love with  her   or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side   one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right  but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland   here  she must be leading a life of privation and penance  there it would have been all enjoyment   as to the pretence of trying her native air  i look upon that as a mere excuse   in the summer it might have passed  but what can any body  native air do for them in the months of january  february  and march   good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health  and i dare say in her   i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions  though you make so noble a profession of doing it  but i honestly tell you what they are     and  upon my word  they have an air of great probability  mr  dixon  preference of her music to her friend   i can answer for being very decided     and then  he saved her life   did you ever hear of that    a water party  and by some accident she was falling overboard  he caught her     he did   i was there  one of the party     were you really   well!  but you observed nothing of course  for it seems to be a new idea to you   if i had been there  i think i should have made some discoveries     i dare say you would  but i  simple i  saw nothing but the fact  that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr  dixon caught her   it was the work of a moment   and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable  indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again   yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable   i do not mean to say  however  that you might not have made discoveries    the conversation was here interrupted   they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses  and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others  but when the table was again safely covered  when every corner dish was placed exactly right  and occupation and ease were generally restored  emma said    the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me   i wanted to know a little more  and this tells me quite enough   depend upon it  we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr  and mrs  dixon     and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells     no  i am sure it is not from the campbells   miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells  or they would have been guessed at first  she would not have been puzzled  had she dared fix on them  i may not have convinced you perhaps  but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr  dixon is a principal in the business     indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced   your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely   at first  while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver  i saw it only as paternal kindness  and thought it the most natural thing in the world   but when you mentioned mrs  dixon  i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship  and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love    there was no occasion to press the matter farther   the conviction seemed real  he looked as if he felt it   she said no more  other subjects took their turn  and the rest of the dinner passed away  the dessert succeeded  the children came in  and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation  a few clever things said  a few downright silly  but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other  nothing worse than everyday remarks  dull repetitions  old news  and heavy jokes   the ladies had not been long in the drawing room  before the other ladies  in their different divisions  arrived   emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend  and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace  she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner  but could most heartily rejoice in that light  cheerful  unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure  in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection  there she sat  and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding   to be in company  nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed  to sit and smile and look pretty  and say nothing  was enough for the happiness of the present hour  jane fairfax did look and move superior  but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet  very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved  yes  of having loved even mr  elton in vain  by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend   in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her  she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte  she felt too much in the secret herself  to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair  and therefore purposely kept at a distance  but by the others  the subject was almost immediately introduced  and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received  the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of  my excellent friend colonel campbell    mrs  weston  kind hearted and musical  was particularly interested by the circumstance  and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject  and having so much to ask and to say as to tone  touch  and pedal  totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible  which she plainly read in the fair heroine  countenance   they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen  and the very first of the early was frank churchill   in he walked  the first and the handsomest  and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece  made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle  where sat miss woodhouse  and till he could find a seat by her  would not sit at all   emma divined what every body present must be thinking   she was his object  and every body must perceive it  she introduced him to her friend  miss smith  and  at convenient moments afterwards  heard what each thought of the other    he had never seen so lovely a face  and was delighted with her naivete   and she   only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment  but she did think there were some looks a little like mr  elton   emma restrained her indignation  and only turned from her in silence   smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax  but it was most prudent to avoid speech  he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room   hated sitting long  was always the first to move when he could   that his father  mr  knightley  mr  cox  and mr  cole  were left very busy over parish business  that as long as he had staid  however  it had been pleasant enough  as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike  sensible men  and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether  thought it so abundant in agreeable families   that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much   she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire   the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe  and the sort  and could make out from his answers that  as far as enscombe was concerned  there was very little going on  that their visitings were among a range of great families  none very near  and that even when days were fixed  and invitations accepted  it was an even chance that mrs  churchill were not in health and spirits for going  that they made a point of visiting no fresh person  and that  though he had his separate engagements  it was not without difficulty  without considerable address  at   times   that he could get away  or introduce an acquaintance for a night   she saw that enscombe could not satisfy  and that highbury  taken at its best  might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked   his importance at enscombe was very evident   he did not boast  but it naturally betrayed itself  that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing  and on her laughing and noticing it  he owned that he believed  excepting one or two points  he could  with   time  persuade her to any thing  one of those points on which his influence failed  he then mentioned  he had wanted very much to go abroad  had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel  but she would not hear of it   this had happened the year before    now   he said  he was beginning to have no longer the same wish   the unpersuadable point  which he did not mention  emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father    i have made a most wretched discovery   said he  after a short pause     i have been here a week to morrow  half my time   i never knew days fly so fast   a week to morrow!  and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself   but just got acquainted with mrs  weston  and others!   i hate the recollection     perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day  out of so few  in having your hair cut     no   said he  smiling   that is no subject of regret at all  i have no pleasure in seeing my friends  unless i can believe myself fit to be seen    the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room  emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes  and listen to mr  cole  when mr  cole had moved away  and her attention could be restored as before  she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax  who was sitting exactly opposite    what is the matter   said she   he started    thank you for rousing me   he replied    i believe i have been very rude  but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way  so very odd a way  that i cannot keep my eyes from her   i never saw any thing so outree!  those curls!  this must be a fancy of her own   i see nobody else looking like her!   i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion   shall i    yes  i will  i declare i will  and you shall see how she takes it    whether she colours    he was gone immediately  and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax  and talking to her  but as to its effect on the young lady  as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them  exactly in front of miss fairfax  she could absolutely distinguish nothing   before he could return to his chair  it was taken by mrs  weston    this is the luxury of a large party   said she    one can get near every body  and say every thing   my dear emma  i am longing to talk to you   i have been making discoveries and forming plans  just like yourself  and i must tell them while the idea is fresh  do you know how miss bates and her niece came here     how   they were invited  were not they     oh! yes  but how they were conveyed hither   the manner of their coming     they walked  i conclude   how else could they come     very true   well  a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again  late at night  and cold as the nights are now   and as i looked at her  though i never saw her appear to more advantage  it struck me that she was heated  and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold  poor girl!  i could not bear the idea of it  so  as soon as mr  weston came into the room  and i could get at him  i spoke to him about the carriage   you may guess how readily he came into my wishes  and having his approbation  i made my way directly to miss bates  to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home  for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once  good soul! she was as grateful as possible  you may be sure  `nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'  but with many  many thanks  `there was no occasion to trouble us  for mr  knightley  carriage had brought  and was to take them home again '  i was quite surprized   very glad  i am sure  but really quite surprized  such a very kind attention  and so thoughtful an attention!   the sort of thing that so few men would think of   and  in short  from knowing his usual ways  i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all  i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself  and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them     very likely   said emma   nothing more likely   i know no man more likely than mr  knightley to do the sort of thing  to do any thing really good natured  useful  considerate  or benevolent  he is not a gallant man  but he is a very humane one  and this  considering jane fairfax  ill health  would appear a case of humanity to him   and for an act of unostentatious kindness  there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr  knightley  i know he had horses to day  for we arrived together  and i laughed at him about it  but he said not a word that could betray     well   said mrs  weston  smiling   you give him credit for more simple  disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do  for while miss bates was speaking  a suspicion darted into my head  and i have never been able to get it out again   the more i think of it  the more probable it appears   in short  i have made a match between mr  knightley and jane fairfax   see the consequence of keeping you company!  what do you say to it     mr  knightley and jane fairfax!  exclaimed emma    dear mrs  weston  how could you think of such a thing   mr  knightley!  mr  knightley must not marry!  you would not have little henry cut out from donwell    oh! no  no  henry must have donwell   i cannot at all consent to mr  knightley  marrying  and i am sure it is not at all likely  i am amazed that you should think of such a thing     my dear emma  i have told you what led me to think of it  i do not want the match  i do not want to injure dear little henry   but the idea has been given me by circumstances  and if mr  knightley really wished to marry  you would not have him refrain on henry  account  a boy of six years old  who knows nothing of the matter     yes  i would   i could not bear to have henry supplanted    mr  knightley marry!  no  i have never had such an idea  and i cannot adopt it now   and jane fairfax  too  of all women!    nay  she has always been a first favourite with him  as you very well know     but the imprudence of such a match!    i am not speaking of its prudence  merely its probability     i see no probability in it  unless you have any better foundation than what you mention   his good nature  his humanity  as i tell you  would be quite enough to account for the horses   he has a great regard for the bateses  you know  independent of jane fairfax   and is always glad to shew them attention   my dear mrs  weston  do not take to match making   you do it very ill   jane fairfax mistress of the abbey!  oh! no  no   every feeling revolts   for his own sake  i would not have him do so mad a thing     imprudent  if you please  but not mad   excepting inequality of fortune  and perhaps a little disparity of age  i can see nothing unsuitable     but mr  knightley does not want to marry   i am sure he has not the least idea of it   do not put it into his head   why should he marry    he is as happy as possible by himself  with his farm  and his sheep  and his library  and all the parish to manage  and he is extremely fond of his brother  children   he has no occasion to marry  either to fill up his time or his heart     my dear emma  as long as he thinks so  it is so  but if he really loves jane fairfax      nonsense!  he does not care about jane fairfax   in the way of love  i am sure he does not   he would do any good to her  or her family  but      well   said mrs  weston  laughing   perhaps the greatest good he could do them  would be to give jane such a respectable home     if it would be good to her  i am sure it would be evil to himself  a very shameful and degrading connexion   how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him   to have her haunting the abbey  and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane    `so very kind and obliging!  but he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'  and then fly off  through half a sentence  to her mother  old petticoat   `not that it was such a very old petticoat either  for still it would last a great while  and  indeed  she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong '    for shame  emma!  do not mimic her   you divert me against my conscience   and  upon my word  i do not think mr  knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates   little things do not irritate him  she might talk on  and if he wanted to say any thing himself  he would only talk louder  and drown her voice   but the question is not  whether it would be a bad connexion for him  but whether he wishes it  and i think he does   i have heard him speak  and so must you  so very highly of jane fairfax!  the interest he takes in her   his anxiety about her health  his concern that she should have no happier prospect!  i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!  such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte  and of her voice!  i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever   oh! and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me  this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody   though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells  may it not be from mr  knightley   i cannot help suspecting him   i think he is just the person to do it  even without being in love     then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love  but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do  mr  knightley does nothing mysteriously     i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly  oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would  in the common course of things  occur to him     very well  and if he had intended to give her one  he would have told her so     there might be scruples of delicacy  my dear emma   i have a very strong notion that it comes from him   i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs  cole told us of it at dinner     you take up an idea  mrs  weston  and run away with it  as you have many a time reproached me with doing   i see no sign of attachment   i believe nothing of the pianoforte  and proof only shall convince me that mr  knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax    they combated the point some time longer in the same way  emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend  for mrs  weston was the most used of the two to yield  till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over  and the instrument in preparation    and at the same moment mr  cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it   frank churchill  of whom  in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs  weston  she had been seeing nothing  except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax  followed mr  cole  to add his very pressing entreaties  and as  in every respect  it suited emma best to lead  she gave a very proper compliance   she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit  she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable  and could accompany her own voice well   one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize  a second  slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill   her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song  and every thing usual followed   he was accused of having a delightful voice  and a perfect knowledge of music  which was properly denied  and that he knew nothing of the matter  and had no voice at all  roundly asserted   they sang together once more  and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax  whose performance  both vocal and instrumental  she never could attempt to conceal from herself  was infinitely superior to her own   with mixed feelings  she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument  to listen   frank churchill sang again  they had sung together once or twice  it appeared  at weymouth  but the sight of mr  knightley among the most attentive  soon drew away half emma  mind  and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs  weston  suspicions  to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions  her objections to mr  knightley  marrying did not in the least subside  she could see nothing but evil in it   it would be a great disappointment to mr  john knightley  consequently to isabella  a real injury to the children  a most mortifying change  and material loss to them all   a very great deduction from her father  daily comfort  and  as to herself  she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey   a mrs  knightley for them all to give way to!  no  mr  knightley must never marry  little henry must remain the heir of donwell   presently mr  knightley looked back  and came and sat down by her  they talked at first only of the performance   his admiration was certainly very warm  yet she thought  but for mrs  weston  it would not have struck her   as a sort of touchstone  however  she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece  and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short  she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own    i often feel concern   said she   that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions   it is not that i am without the wish  but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose     quite out of the question  quite out of the question   he replied     but you must often wish it  i am sure    and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction  that she must proceed another step    this present from the campbells   said she   this pianoforte is very kindly given     yes   he replied  and without the smallest apparent embarrassment     but they would have done better had they given her notice of it  surprizes are foolish things   the pleasure is not enhanced  and the inconvenience is often considerable   i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell    from that moment  emma could have taken her oath that mr  knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument   but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment  whether there were no actual preference  remained a little longer doubtful  towards the end of jane  second song  her voice grew thick    that will do   said he  when it was finished  thinking aloud    you have sung quite enough for one evening  now be quiet    another song  however  was soon begged for    one more   they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account  and would only ask for one more    and frank churchill was heard to say   i think you could manage this without effort  the first part is so very trifling  the strength of the song falls on the second    mr  knightley grew angry    that fellow   said he  indignantly   thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice   this must not be    and touching miss bates  who at that moment passed near   miss bates  are you mad  to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner   go  and interfere  they have no mercy on her    miss bates  in her real anxiety for jane  could hardly stay even to be grateful  before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing   here ceased the concert part of the evening  for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers  but soon  within five minutes  the proposal of dancing   originating nobody exactly knew where  was so effectually promoted by mr  and mrs  cole  that every thing was rapidly clearing away  to give proper space   mrs  weston  capital in her country dances  was seated  and beginning an irresistible waltz  and frank churchill  coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma  had secured her hand  and led her up to the top   while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off  emma found time  in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste  to look about  and see what became of mr  knightley  this would be a trial   he was no dancer in general   if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now  it might augur something  there was no immediate appearance   no  he was talking to mrs  cole   he was looking on unconcerned  jane was asked by somebody else  and he was still talking to mrs  cole   emma had no longer an alarm for henry  his interest was yet safe  and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment  not more than five couple could be mustered  but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful  and she found herself well matched in a partner   they were a couple worth looking at   two dances  unfortunately  were all that could be allowed  it was growing late  and miss bates became anxious to get home  on her mother  account   after some attempts  therefore  to be permitted to begin again  they were obliged to thank mrs  weston  look sorrowful  and have done    perhaps it is as well   said frank churchill  as he attended emma to her carriage    i must have asked miss fairfax  and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me  after your       chapter ix   emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles  the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day  and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion  must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity   she must have delighted the coles  worthy people  who deserved to be made happy!  and left a name behind her that would not soon die away   perfect happiness  even in memory  is not common  and there were two points on which she was not quite easy   she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman  in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax  feelings to frank churchill  it was hardly right  but it had been so strong an idea  that it would escape her  and his submission to all that she told  was a compliment to her penetration  which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue   the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax  and there she had no doubt   she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing   she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood  and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half   she was then interrupted by harriet  coming in  and if harriet  praise could have satisfied her  she might soon have been comforted    oh! if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax!    don't class us together  harriet   my playing is no more like her   than a lamp is like sunshine     oh! dear  i think you play the best of the two   i think you play quite as well as she does   i am sure i had much rather hear you  every body last night said how well you played     those who knew any thing about it  must have felt the difference  the truth is  harriet  that my playing is just good enough to be praised  but jane fairfax  is much beyond it     well  i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does  or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out  mr  cole said how much taste you had  and mr  frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste  and that he valued taste much more than execution     ah! but jane fairfax has them both  harriet     are you sure   i saw she had execution  but i did not know she had any taste   nobody talked about it   and i hate italian singing    there is no understanding a word of it   besides  if she does play so very well  you know  it is no more than she is obliged to do  because she will have to teach   the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family   how did you think the coxes looked     just as they always do  very vulgar     they told me something   said harriet rather hesitatingly   but it is nothing of any consequence    emma was obliged to ask what they had told her  though fearful of its producing mr  elton    they told me  that mr  martin dined with them last saturday     oh!    he came to their father upon some business  and he asked him to stay to dinner     oh!    they talked a great deal about him  especially anne cox  i do not know what she meant  but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer     she meant to be impertinently curious  just as such an anne cox should be     she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there   he sat by her at dinner   miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him     very likely   i think they are  without exception  the most vulgar girls in highbury    harriet had business at ford    emma thought it most prudent to go with her   another accidental meeting with the martins was possible  and in her present state  would be dangerous   harriet  tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word  was always very long at a purchase  and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind  emma went to the door for amusement   much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury    mr  perry walking hastily by  mr  william cox letting himself in at the office door  mr  cole  carriage horses returning from exercise  or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule  were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect  and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket  two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone  and a string of dawdling children round the baker  little bow window eyeing the gingerbread  she knew she had no reason to complain  and was amused enough  quite enough still to stand at the door  a mind lively and at ease  can do with seeing nothing  and can see nothing that does not answer   she looked down the randalls road   the scene enlarged  two persons appeared  mrs  weston and her son in law  they were walking into highbury   to hartfield of course   they were stopping  however  in the first place at mrs  bates   whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford   and had all but knocked  when emma caught their eye   immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her  and the agreeableness of yesterday  engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting  mrs  weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses  in order to hear the new instrument    for my companion tells me   said she   that i absolutely promised miss bates last night  that i would come this morning   i was not aware of it myself   i did not know that i had fixed a day  but as he says i did  i am going now     and while mrs  weston pays her visit  i may be allowed  i hope   said frank churchill   to join your party and wait for her at hartfield   if you are going home    mrs  weston was disappointed    i thought you meant to go with me   they would be very much pleased     me!  i should be quite in the way   but  perhaps  i may be equally in the way here   miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me  my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping   she says i fidget her to death  and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same   what am i to do     i am here on no business of my own   said emma   i am only waiting for my friend   she will probably have soon done  and then we shall go home   but you had better go with mrs  weston and hear the instrument     well  if you advise it   but  with a smile  if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend  and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone  what shall i say   i shall be no support to mrs  weston   she might do very well by herself  a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips  but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood     i do not believe any such thing   replied emma    i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours  when it is necessary  but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent  quite otherwise indeed  if i understood miss fairfax  opinion last night     do come with me   said mrs  weston   if it be not very disagreeable to you   it need not detain us long   we will go to hartfield afterwards  we will follow them to hartfield   i really wish you to call with me  it will be felt so great an attention! and i always thought you meant it    he could say no more  and with the hope of hartfield to reward him  returned with mrs  weston to mrs  bates  door   emma watched them in  and then joined harriet at the interesting counter   trying  with all the force of her own mind  to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured  and that a blue ribbon  be it ever so beautiful  would still never match her yellow pattern  at last it was all settled  even to the destination of the parcel    should i send it to mrs  goddard   ma'am   asked mrs  ford     yes  no  yes  to mrs  goddard   only my pattern gown is at hartfield   no  you shall send it to hartfield  if you please  but then  mrs  goddard will want to see it   and i could take the pattern gown home any day   but i shall want the ribbon directly   so it had better go to hartfield  at least the ribbon   you could make it into two parcels  mrs  ford  could not you     it is not worth while  harriet  to give mrs  ford the trouble of two parcels     no more it is     no trouble in the world  ma'am   said the obliging mrs  ford    oh! but indeed i would much rather have it only in one  then  if you please  you shall send it all to mrs  goddard    i do not know  no  i think  miss woodhouse  i may just as well have it sent to hartfield  and take it home with me at night  what do you advise     that you do not give another half second to the subject  to hartfield  if you please  mrs  ford     aye  that will be much best   said harriet  quite satisfied   i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs  goddard     voices approached the shop  or rather one voice and two ladies  mrs  weston and miss bates met them at the door    my dear miss woodhouse   said the latter   i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while  and give us your opinion of our new instrument  you and miss smith  how do you do  miss smith   very well i thank you   and i begged mrs  weston to come with me  that i might be sure of succeeding     i hope mrs  bates and miss fairfax are      very well  i am much obliged to you   my mother is delightfully well  and jane caught no cold last night   how is mr  woodhouse   i am so glad to hear such a good account   mrs  weston told me you were here    oh! then  said i  i must run across  i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in  my mother will be so very happy to see her  and now we are such a nice party  she cannot refuse   `aye  pray do ' said mr  frank churchill  `miss woodhouse  opinion of the instrument will be worth having '   but  said i  i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me   `oh ' said he  `wait half a minute  till i have finished my job '  for  would you believe it  miss woodhouse  there he is  in the most obliging manner in the world  fastening in the rivet of my mother  spectacles   the rivet came out  you know  this morning    so very obliging!  for my mother had no use of her spectacles   could not put them on   and  by the bye  every body ought to have two pair of spectacles  they should indeed   jane said so  i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did  but something or other hindered me all the morning  first one thing  then another  there is no saying what  you know   at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping   oh  said i  patty do not come with your bad news to me   here is the rivet of your mistress  spectacles out   then the baked apples came home  mrs  wallis sent them by her boy  they are extremely civil and obliging to us  the wallises  always  i have heard some people say that mrs  wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer  but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them   and it cannot be for the value of our custom now  for what is our consumption of bread  you know   only three of us    besides dear jane at present  and she really eats nothing  makes such a shocking breakfast  you would be quite frightened if you saw it  i dare not let my mother know how little she eats  so i say one thing and then i say another  and it passes off   but about the middle of the day she gets hungry  and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples  and they are extremely wholesome  for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr  perry  i happened to meet him in the street   not that i had any doubt before   i have so often heard mr  woodhouse recommend a baked apple  i believe it is the only way that mr  woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome   we have apple dumplings  however  very often   patty makes an excellent apple dumpling  well  mrs  weston  you have prevailed  i hope  and these ladies will oblige us    emma would be  very happy to wait on mrs  bates  &c    and they did at last move out of the shop  with no farther delay from miss bates than    how do you do  mrs  ford   i beg your pardon   i did not see you before   i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town   jane came back delighted yesterday   thank ye  the gloves do very well  only a little too large about the wrist  but jane is taking them in     what was i talking of   said she  beginning again when they were all in the street   emma wondered on what  of all the medley  she would fix    i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of   oh! my mother  spectacles   so very obliging of mr  frank churchill! `oh!' said he  `i do think i can fasten the rivet  i like a job of this kind excessively '  which you know shewed him to be so very        indeed i must say that  much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected  he very far exceeds any thing        i do congratulate you  mrs  weston  most warmly  he seems every thing the fondest parent could        `oh!' said he  `i can fasten the rivet   i like a job of that sort excessively ' i never shall forget his manner   and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet  and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some  `oh!' said he directly  `there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good  and these are the finest looking home baked apples i ever saw in my life '  that  you know  was so very        and i am sure  by his manner  it was no compliment  indeed they are very delightful apples  and mrs  wallis does them full justice  only we do not have them baked more than twice  and mr  woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times   but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it   the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking  beyond a doubt  all from donwell  some of mr  knightley  most liberal supply  he sends us a sack every year  and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees  i believe there is two of them   my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days   but i was really quite shocked the other day   for mr  knightley called one morning  and jane was eating these apples  and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them  and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock  `i am sure you must be ' said he  `and i will send you another supply  for i have a great many more than i can ever use  william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year  i will send you some more  before they get good for nothing ' so i begged he would not  for really as to ours being gone  i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left  it was but half a dozen indeed  but they should be all kept for jane  and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more  so liberal as he had been already  and jane said the same   and when he was gone  she almost quarrelled with me  no  i should not say quarrelled  for we never had a quarrel in our lives  but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone  she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left   oh  said i  my dear  i did say as much as i could   however  the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples  the same sort of apples  a bushel at least  and i was very much obliged  and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing  as you may suppose   william larkins is such an old acquaintance! i am always glad to see him   but  however  i found afterwards from patty  that william said it was all the apples of  that  sort his master had  he had brought them all  and now his master had not one left to bake or boil   william did not seem to mind it himself  he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many  for william  you know  thinks more of his master  profit than any thing  but mrs  hodges  he said  was quite displeased at their being all sent away   she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring   he told patty this  but bid her not mind it  and be sure not to say any thing to us about it  for mrs  hodges  would  be cross sometimes  and as long as so many sacks were sold  it did not signify who ate the remainder  and so patty told me  and i was excessively shocked indeed! i would not have mr  knightley know any thing about it for the world!  he would be so very        i wanted to keep it from jane  knowledge  but  unluckily  i had mentioned it before i was aware    miss bates had just done as patty opened the door  and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to  pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will    pray take care  mrs  weston  there is a step at the turning  pray take care  miss woodhouse  ours is rather a dark staircase   rather darker and narrower than one could wish   miss smith  pray take care   miss woodhouse  i am quite concerned  i am sure you hit your foot   miss smith  the step at the turning      chapter x   the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered  was tranquillity itself  mrs  bates  deprived of her usual employment  slumbering on one side of the fire  frank churchill  at a table near her  most deedily occupied about her spectacles  and jane fairfax  standing with her back to them  intent on her pianoforte   busy as he was  however  the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again    this is a pleasure   said he  in rather a low voice   coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated   you find me trying to be useful  tell me if you think i shall succeed     what!  said mrs  weston   have not you finished it yet  you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate     i have not been working uninterruptedly   he replied   i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily  it was not quite firm  an unevenness in the floor  i believe  you see we have been wedging one leg with paper   this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come   i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home    he contrived that she should be seated by him  and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her  and trying to make her help or advise him in his work  till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again   that she was not immediately ready  emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves  she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion  she must reason herself into the power of performance  and emma could not but pity such feelings  whatever their origin  and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again   at last jane began  and though the first bars were feebly given  the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to  mrs  weston had been delighted before  and was delighted again  emma joined her in all her praise  and the pianoforte  with every proper discrimination  was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise    whoever colonel campbell might employ   said frank churchill  with a smile at emma   the person has not chosen ill   i heard a good deal of colonel campbell  taste at weymouth  and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and  all   that   party  would particularly prize   i dare say  miss fairfax  that he either gave his friend very minute directions  or wrote to broadwood himself  do not you think so    jane did not look round   she was not obliged to hear   mrs  weston had been speaking to her at the same moment    it is not fair   said emma  in a whisper   mine was a random guess  do not distress her    he shook his head with a smile  and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy   soon afterwards he began again    how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion  miss fairfax   i dare say they often think of you  and wonder which will be the day  the precise day of the instrument  coming to hand   do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time   do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him  or that he may have sent only a general direction  an order indefinite as to time  to depend upon contingencies and conveniences    he paused   she could not but hear  she could not avoid answering    till i have a letter from colonel campbell   said she  in a voice of forced calmness   i can imagine nothing with any confidence  it must be all conjecture     conjecture  aye  sometimes one conjectures right  and sometimes one conjectures wrong   i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm   what nonsense one talks  miss woodhouse  when hard at work  if one talks at all   your real workmen  i suppose  hold their tongues  but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word  miss fairfax said something about conjecturing  there  it is done   i have the pleasure  madam   to mrs  bates   of restoring your spectacles  healed for the present    he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter  to escape a little from the latter  he went to the pianoforte  and begged miss fairfax  who was still sitting at it  to play something more    if you are very kind   said he   it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night   let me live them over again   you did not enjoy them as i did  you appeared tired the whole time   i believe you were glad we danced no longer  but i would have given worlds   all the worlds one ever has to give  for another half hour    she played    what felicity it is to hear a tune again which  has  made one happy!   if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth    she looked up at him for a moment  coloured deeply  and played something else   he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte  and turning to emma  said    here is something quite new to me   do you know it   cramer    and here are a new set of irish melodies   that  from such a quarter  one might expect   this was all sent with the instrument   very thoughtful of colonel campbell  was not it   he knew miss fairfax could have no music here   i honour that part of the attention particularly  it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart   nothing hastily done  nothing incomplete   true affection only could have prompted it    emma wished he would be less pointed  yet could not help being amused  and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile  when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness  there had been a smile of secret delight  she had less scruple in the amusement  and much less compunction with respect to her   this amiable  upright  perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings   he brought all the music to her  and they looked it over together    emma took the opportunity of whispering    you speak too plain   she must understand you     i hope she does   i would have her understand me   i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning     but really  i am half ashamed  and wish i had never taken up the idea     i am very glad you did  and that you communicated it to me  i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways   leave shame to her  if she does wrong  she ought to feel it     she is not entirely without it  i think     i do not see much sign of it   she is playing  robin   adair  at this moment   his  favourite    shortly afterwards miss bates  passing near the window  descried mr  knightley on horse back not far off    mr  knightley i declare!  i must speak to him if possible  just to thank him   i will not open the window here  it would give you all cold  but i can go into my mother  room you know   i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here   quite delightful to have you all meet so!  our little room so honoured!   she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke  and opening the casement there  immediately called mr  knightley  attention  and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others  as if it had passed within the same apartment    how d' ye do   how d'ye do   very well  i thank you   so obliged to you for the carriage last night   we were just in time  my mother just ready for us   pray come in  do come in   you will find some friends here    so began miss bates  and mr  knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn  for most resolutely and commandingly did he say    how is your niece  miss bates   i want to inquire after you all  but particularly your niece   how is miss fairfax   i hope she caught no cold last night   how is she to day  tell me how miss fairfax is    and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else   the listeners were amused  and mrs  weston gave emma a look of particular meaning   but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism    so obliged to you!  so very much obliged to you for the carriage   resumed miss bates   he cut her short with    i am going to kingston   can i do any thing for you     oh! dear  kingston  are you   mrs  cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston     mrs  cole has servants to send   can i do any thing for  you      no  i thank you   but do come in   who do you think is here    miss woodhouse and miss smith  so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte   do put up your horse at the crown  and come in     well   said he  in a deliberating manner   for five minutes  perhaps     and here is mrs  weston and mr  frank churchill too!  quite delightful  so many friends!    no  not now  i thank you   i could not stay two minutes  i must get on to kingston as fast as i can     oh! do come in   they will be so very happy to see you     no  no  your room is full enough   i will call another day  and hear the pianoforte     well  i am so sorry!  oh!  mr  knightley  what a delightful party last night  how extremely pleasant   did you ever see such dancing    was not it delightful   miss woodhouse and mr  frank churchill  i never saw any thing equal to it     oh! very delightful indeed  i can say nothing less  for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr  frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes   and  raising his voice still more  i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too   i think miss fairfax dances very well  and mrs  weston is the very best country dance player  without exception  in england   now  if your friends have any gratitude  they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return  but i cannot stay to hear it     oh!  mr  knightley  one moment more  something of consequence   so shocked!  jane and i are both so shocked about the apples!    what is the matter now     to think of your sending us all your store apples   you said you had a great many  and now you have not one left   we really are so shocked! mrs  hodges may well be angry   william larkins mentioned it here  you should not have done it  indeed you should not   ah! he is off  he never can bear to be thanked   but i thought he would have staid now  and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned        well   returning to the room   i have not been able to succeed  mr  knightley cannot stop   he is going to kingston   he asked me if he could do any thing           yes   said jane   we heard his kind offers  we heard every thing     oh! yes  my dear  i dare say you might  because you know  the door was open  and the window was open  and mr  knightley spoke loud  you must have heard every thing to be sure   `can i do any thing for you at kingston ' said he  so i just mentioned        oh! miss woodhouse  must you be going   you seem but just come  so very obliging of you    emma found it really time to be at home  the visit had already lasted long  and on examining watches  so much of the morning was perceived to be gone  that mrs  weston and her companion taking leave also  could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates  before they set off for randalls     chapter xi   it may be possible to do without dancing entirely   instances have been known of young people passing many  many months successively  without being at any ball of any description  and no material injury accrue either to body or mind   but when a beginning is made   when the felicities of rapid motion have once been  though slightly  felt  it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more   frank churchill had danced once at highbury  and longed to dance again  and the last half hour of an evening which mr  woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls  was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject   frank  was the first idea  and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it  for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties  and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance   but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr  frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced  for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax  and even for simple dancing itself  without any of the wicked aids of vanity  to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold  and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour  in the hope of discovering  in spite of all that mr  weston could say of their exactly equal size  that it was a little the largest   his first proposition and request  that the dance begun at mr  cole  should be finished there  that the same party should be collected  and the same musician engaged  met with the readiest acquiescence  mr  weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment  and mrs  weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance  and the interesting employment had followed  of reckoning up exactly who there would be  and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple    you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two miss coxes five   had been repeated many times over    and there will be the two gilberts  young cox  my father  and myself  besides mr  knightley   yes  that will be quite enough for pleasure  you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two miss coxes five  and for five couple there will be plenty of room    but soon it came to be on one side    but will there be good room for five couple   i really do not think there will    on another    and after all  five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up   five couple are nothing  when one thinks seriously about it   it will not do to  invite  five couple  it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment    somebody said that  miss  gilbert was expected at her brother   and must be invited with the rest   somebody else believed  mrs   gilbert would have danced the other evening  if she had been asked   a word was put in for a second young cox  and at last  mr  weston naming one family of cousins who must be included  and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out  it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten  and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of   the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other   might not they use both rooms  and dance across the passage   it seemed the best scheme  and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better   emma said it would be awkward  mrs  weston was in distress about the supper  and mr  woodhouse opposed it earnestly  on the score of health   it made him so very unhappy  indeed  that it could not be persevered in    oh! no   said he   it would be the extreme of imprudence  i could not bear it for emma!  emma is not strong   she would catch a dreadful cold   so would poor little harriet  so you would all   mrs  weston  you would be quite laid up  do not let them talk of such a wild thing   pray do not let them talk of it   that young man  speaking lower  is very thoughtless  do not tell his father  but that young man is not quite the thing  he has been opening the doors very often this evening  and keeping them open very inconsiderately   he does not think of the draught  i do not mean to set you against him  but indeed he is not quite the thing!   mrs  weston was sorry for such a charge   she knew the importance of it  and said every thing in her power to do it away   every door was now closed  the passage plan given up  and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again  and with such good will on frank churchill  part  that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple  was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten    we were too magnificent   said he    we allowed unnecessary room  ten couple may stand here very well    emma demurred    it would be a crowd  a sad crowd  and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in     very true   he gravely replied   it was very bad    but still he went on measuring  and still he ended with    i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple     no  no   said she   you are quite unreasonable   it would be dreadful to be standing so close!  nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd  and a crowd in a little room!    there is no denying it   he replied    i agree with you exactly  a crowd in a little room  miss woodhouse  you have the art of giving pictures in a few words   exquisite  quite exquisite!  still  however  having proceeded so far  one is unwilling to give the matter up  it would be a disappointment to my father  and altogether  i do not know that  i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well    emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self willed  and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her  but she took the compliment  and forgave the rest   had she intended ever to  marry  him  it might have been worth while to pause and consider  and try to understand the value of his preference  and the character of his temper  but for all the purposes of their acquaintance  he was quite amiable enough   before the middle of the next day  he was at hartfield  and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme   it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement    well  miss woodhouse   he almost immediately began   your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away  i hope  by the terrors of my father  little rooms   i bring a new proposal on the subject   a thought of my father   which waits only your approbation to be acted upon   may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball  to be given  not at randalls  but at the crown inn     the crown!    yes  if you and mr  woodhouse see no objection  and i trust you cannot  my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there  better accommodations  he can promise them  and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls   it is his own idea   mrs  weston sees no objection to it  provided you are satisfied   this is what we all feel   oh! you were perfectly right!  ten couple  in either of the randalls rooms  would have been insufferable!  dreadful!  i felt how right you were the whole time  but was too anxious for securing  any   thing  to like to yield   is not it a good exchange   you consent   i hope you consent     it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to  if mr  and mrs  weston do not   i think it admirable  and  as far as i can answer for myself  shall be most happy  it seems the only improvement that could be   papa  do you not think it an excellent improvement    she was obliged to repeat and explain it  before it was fully comprehended  and then  being quite new  farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable    no  he thought it very far from an improvement  a very bad plan   much worse than the other   a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous  never properly aired  or fit to be inhabited  if they must dance  they had better dance at randalls   he had never been in the room at the crown in his life  did not know the people who kept it by sight   oh! no  a very bad plan   they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere     i was going to observe  sir   said frank churchill   that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body  catching cold   so much less danger at the crown than at randalls!  mr  perry might have reason to regret the alteration  but nobody else could     sir   said mr  woodhouse  rather warmly   you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr  perry to be that sort of character  mr  perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill   but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father  house     from the very circumstance of its being larger  sir   we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all  not once the whole evening  and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows  letting in cold air upon heated bodies  which  as you well know  sir  does the mischief     open the windows!  but surely  mr  churchill  nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls   nobody could be so imprudent! i never heard of such a thing   dancing with open windows!  i am sure  neither your father nor mrs  weston  poor miss taylor that was  would suffer it     ah! sir  but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain  and throw up a sash  without its being suspected  i have often known it done myself     have you indeed  sir   bless me!  i never could have supposed it  but i live out of the world  and am often astonished at what i hear  however  this does make a difference  and  perhaps  when we come to talk it over  but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration   one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry  if mr  and mrs  weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning  we may talk it over  and see what can be done     but  unfortunately  sir  my time is so limited      oh!  interrupted emma   there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over   there is no hurry at all   if it can be contrived to be at the crown  papa  it will be very convenient for the horses  they will be so near their own stable     so they will  my dear   that is a great thing   not that james ever complains  but it is right to spare our horses when we can  if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired  but is mrs  stokes to be trusted   i doubt it   i do not know her  even by sight     i can answer for every thing of that nature  sir  because it will be under mrs  weston  care   mrs  weston undertakes to direct the whole     there  papa!  now you must be satisfied  our own dear mrs  weston  who is carefulness itself   do not you remember what mr  perry said  so many years ago  when i had the measles   `if  miss   taylor  undertakes to wrap miss emma up  you need not have any fears  sir '  how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!    aye  very true   mr  perry did say so   i shall never forget it  poor little emma!  you were very bad with the measles  that is  you would have been very bad  but for perry  great attention  he came four times a day for a week   he said  from the first  it was a very good sort  which was our great comfort  but the measles are a dreadful complaint   i hope whenever poor isabella  little ones have the measles  she will send for perry     my father and mrs  weston are at the crown at this moment   said frank churchill   examining the capabilities of the house  i left them there and came on to hartfield  impatient for your opinion  and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot   i was desired to say so from both   it would be the greatest pleasure to them  if you could allow me to attend you there  they can do nothing satisfactorily without you    emma was most happy to be called to such a council  and her father  engaging to think it all over while she was gone  the two young people set off together without delay for the crown   there were mr  and mrs  weston  delighted to see her and receive her approbation  very busy and very happy in their different way  she  in some little distress  and he  finding every thing perfect    emma   said she   this paper is worse than i expected  look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty  and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined     my dear  you are too particular   said her husband    what does all that signify   you will see nothing of it by candlelight  it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight   we never see any thing of it on our club nights    the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant   men never know when things are dirty or not   and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself   women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares    one perplexity  however  arose  which the gentlemen did not disdain  it regarded a supper room   at the time of the ballroom  being built  suppers had not been in question  and a small card room adjoining  was the only addition   what was to be done   this card room would be wanted as a card room now  or  if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves  still was it not too small for any comfortable supper   another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose  but it was at the other end of the house  and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it  this made a difficulty   mrs  weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage  and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper   mrs  weston proposed having no regular supper  merely sandwiches  &c   set out in the little room  but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion   a private dance  without sitting down to supper  was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women  and mrs  weston must not speak of it again   she then took another line of expediency  and looking into the doubtful room  observed    i do not think it  is  so very small   we shall not be many  you know    and mr  weston at the same time  walking briskly with long steps through the passage  was calling out    you talk a great deal of the length of this passage  my dear  it is a mere nothing after all  and not the least draught from the stairs     i wish   said mrs  weston   one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best   to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object  if one could but tell what that would be     yes  very true   cried frank   very true   you want your neighbours' opinions   i do not wonder at you   if one could ascertain what the chief of them  the coles  for instance   they are not far off  shall i call upon them   or miss bates   she is still nearer    and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body   i think we do want a larger council   suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us     well  if you please   said mrs  weston rather hesitating   if you think she will be of any use     you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates   said emma   she will be all delight and gratitude  but she will tell you nothing  she will not even listen to your questions   i see no advantage in consulting miss bates     but she is so amusing  so extremely amusing!  i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk   and i need not bring the whole family  you know    here mr  weston joined them  and on hearing what was proposed  gave it his decided approbation    aye  do  frank   go and fetch miss bates  and let us end the matter at once   she will enjoy the scheme  i am sure  and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties  fetch miss bates   we are growing a little too nice   she is a standing lesson of how to be happy   but fetch them both  invite them both     both sir!  can the old lady           the old lady!  no  the young lady  to be sure   i shall think you a great blockhead  frank  if you bring the aunt without the niece     oh!  i beg your pardon  sir   i did not immediately recollect  undoubtedly if you wish it  i will endeavour to persuade them both   and away he ran   long before he reappeared  attending the short  neat  brisk moving aunt  and her elegant niece   mrs  weston  like a sweet tempered woman and a good wife  had examined the passage again  and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before   indeed very trifling  and here ended the difficulties of decision  all the rest  in speculation at least  was perfectly smooth  all the minor arrangements of table and chair  lights and music  tea and supper  made themselves  or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs  weston and mrs  stokes    every body invited  was certainly to come  frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight  which could not possibly be refused   and a delightful dance it was to be   most cordially  when miss bates arrived  did she agree that it must  as a counsellor she was not wanted  but as an approver   a much safer character   she was truly welcome   her approbation  at once general and minute  warm and incessant  could not but please  and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro  between the different rooms  some suggesting  some attending  and all in happy enjoyment of the future   the party did not break up without emma  being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening  nor without her overhearing mr  weston whisper to his wife   he has asked her  my dear   that  right  i knew he would!     chapter xii   one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma  its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill  stay in surry  for  in spite of mr  weston  confidence  she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight   but this was not judged feasible  the preparations must take their time  nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on  and for a few days they must be planning  proceeding and hoping in uncertainty  at the risk   in her opinion  the great risk  of its being all in vain   enscombe however was gracious  gracious in fact  if not in word  his wish of staying longer evidently did not please  but it was not opposed   all was safe and prosperous  and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another  emma  being now certain of her ball  began to adopt as the next vexation mr  knightley  provoking indifference about it   either because he did not dance himself  or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted  he seemed resolved that it should not interest him  determined against its exciting any present curiosity  or affording him any future amusement   to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply  than    very well   if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment  i have nothing to say against it  but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me    oh! yes  i must be there  i could not refuse  and i will keep as much awake as i can  but i would rather be at home  looking over william larkins  week  account  much rather  i confess    pleasure in seeing dancing!  not i  indeed  i never look at it   i do not know who does   fine dancing  i believe  like virtue  must be its own reward   those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different    this emma felt was aimed at her  and it made her quite angry  it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent  or so indignant  he was not guided by  her  feelings in reprobating the ball  for  she  enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree   it made her animated  open hearted   she voluntarily said      oh!  miss woodhouse  i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball  what a disappointment it would be!  i do look forward to it  i own  with  very  great pleasure    it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins   no!  she was more and more convinced that mrs  weston was quite mistaken in that surmise  there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side  but no love   alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr  knightley  two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing   a letter arrived from mr  churchill to urge his nephew  instant return   mrs  churchill was unwell   far too unwell to do without him  she had been in a very suffering state  so said her husband  when writing to her nephew two days before  though from her usual unwillingness to give pain  and constant habit of never thinking of herself  she had not mentioned it  but now she was too ill to trifle  and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay   the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma  in a note from mrs  weston  instantly   as to his going  it was inevitable  he must be gone within a few hours  though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt  to lessen his repugnance   he knew her illnesses  they never occurred but for her own convenience   mrs  weston added   that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury  after breakfast  and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him  and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon    this wretched note was the finale of emma  breakfast   when once it had been read  there was no doing any thing  but lament and exclaim   the loss of the ball  the loss of the young man   and all that the young man might be feeling!  it was too wretched!   such a delightful evening as it would have been!  every body so happy! and she and her partner the happiest!   i said it would be so   was the only consolation   her father  feelings were quite distinct   he thought principally of mrs  churchill  illness  and wanted to know how she was treated  and as for the ball  it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed  but they would all be safer at home   emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared  but if this reflected at all upon his impatience  his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him  he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it   his dejection was most evident   he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes  and when rousing himself  it was only to say    of all horrid things  leave taking is the worst     but you will come again   said emma    this will not be your only visit to randalls     ah!   shaking his head   the uncertainty of when i may be able to return!  i shall try for it with a zeal!  it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!  and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring  but i am afraid  they did not stir last spring   i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever     our poor ball must be quite given up     ah! that ball!  why did we wait for any thing   why not seize the pleasure at once   how often is happiness destroyed by preparation  foolish preparation!  you told us it would be so   oh!  miss woodhouse  why are you always so right     indeed  i am very sorry to be right in this instance   i would much rather have been merry than wise     if i can come again  we are still to have our ball   my father depends on it   do not forget your engagement    emma looked graciously    such a fortnight as it has been!  he continued   every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!  every day making me less fit to bear any other place   happy those  who can remain at highbury!    as you do us such ample justice now   said emma  laughing   i will venture to ask  whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first  do not we rather surpass your expectations   i am sure we do  i am sure you did not much expect to like us   you would not have been so long in coming  if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury    he laughed rather consciously  and though denying the sentiment  emma was convinced that it had been so    and you must be off this very morning     yes  my father is to join me here   we shall walk back together  and i must be off immediately   i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him     not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates   how unlucky!  miss bates  powerful  argumentative mind might have strengthened yours     yes  i  have  called there  passing the door  i thought it better  it was a right thing to do   i went in for three minutes  and was detained by miss bates  being absent   she was out  and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in   she is a woman that one may  that one  must  laugh at  but that one would not wish to slight  it was better to pay my visit  then     he hesitated  got up  walked to a window    in short   said he   perhaps  miss woodhouse  i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion     he looked at her  as if wanting to read her thoughts   she hardly knew what to say   it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious  which she did not wish   forcing herself to speak  therefore  in the hope of putting it by  she calmly said    you are quite in the right  it was most natural to pay your visit  then     he was silent   she believed he was looking at her  probably reflecting on what she had said  and trying to understand the manner  she heard him sigh   it was natural for him to feel that he had  cause  to sigh   he could not believe her to be encouraging him  a few awkward moments passed  and he sat down again  and in a more determined manner said    it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield   my regard for hartfield is most warm     he stopt again  rose again  and seemed quite embarrassed    he was more in love with her than emma had supposed  and who can say how it might have ended  if his father had not made his appearance  mr  woodhouse soon followed  and the necessity of exertion made him composed   a very few minutes more  however  completed the present trial  mr  weston  always alert when business was to be done  and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable  as of foreseeing any that was doubtful  said   it was time to go   and the young man  though he might and did sigh  could not but agree  to take leave    i shall hear about you all   said he   that is my chief consolation  i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you   i have engaged mrs  weston to correspond with me   she has been so kind as to promise it   oh! the blessing of a female correspondent  when one is really interested in the absent!  she will tell me every thing  in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again    a very friendly shake of the hand  a very earnest  good bye   closed the speech  and the door had soon shut out frank churchill  short had been the notice  short their meeting  he was gone  and emma felt so sorry to part  and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry  and feeling it too much   it was a sad change   they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival   certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks  indescribable spirit  the idea  the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought  the assurance of his attentions  his liveliness  his manners! it had been a very happy fortnight  and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days   to complete every other recommendation  he had  almost  told her that he loved her  what strength  or what constancy of affection he might be subject to  was another point  but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration  a conscious preference of herself  and this persuasion  joined to all the rest  made her think that she  must  be a little in love with him  in spite of every previous determination against it    i certainly must   said she    this sensation of listlessness  weariness  stupidity  this disinclination to sit down and employ myself  this feeling of every thing  being dull and insipid about the house!   i must be in love  i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not  for a few weeks at least   well! evil to some is always good to others   i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball  if not for frank churchill  but mr  knightley will be happy  he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes    mr  knightley  however  shewed no triumphant happiness   he could not say that he was sorry on his own account  his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had  but he said  and very steadily  that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others  and with considerable kindness added    you  emma  who have so few opportunities of dancing  you are really out of luck  you are very much out of luck!   it was some days before she saw jane fairfax  to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change  but when they did meet  her composure was odious   she had been particularly unwell  however  suffering from headache to a degree  which made her aunt declare  that had the ball taken place  she did not think jane could have attended it  and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill health     chapter xiii   emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love   her ideas only varied as to the how much   at first  she thought it was a good deal  and afterwards  but little   she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of  and  for his sake  greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr  and mrs  weston  she was very often thinking of him  and quite impatient for a letter  that she might know how he was  how were his spirits  how was his aunt  and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring   but  on the other hand  she could not admit herself to be unhappy  nor  after the first morning  to be less disposed for employment than usual  she was still busy and cheerful  and  pleasing as he was  she could yet imagine him to have faults  and farther  though thinking of him so much  and  as she sat drawing or working  forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment  fancying interesting dialogues  and inventing elegant letters  the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she  refused   him    their affection was always to subside into friendship  every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting  but still they were to part   when she became sensible of this  it struck her that she could not be very much in love  for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father  never to marry  a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings    i do not find myself making any use of the word  sacrifice    said she     in not one of all my clever replies  my delicate negatives  is there any allusion to making a sacrifice   i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness   so much the better  i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do   i am quite enough in love   i should be sorry to be more    upon the whole  she was equally contented with her view of his feelings     he  is undoubtedly very much in love  every thing denotes it  very much in love indeed!  and when he comes again  if his affection continue  i must be on my guard not to encourage it   it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise  as my own mind is quite made up  not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto  no  if he had believed me at all to share his feelings  he would not have been so wretched   could he have thought himself encouraged  his looks and language at parting would have been different    still  however  i must be on my guard   this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is  but i do not know that i expect it will  i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man   i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy    his feelings are warm  but i can imagine them rather changeable    every consideration of the subject  in short  makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved   i shall do very well again after a little while  and then  it will be a good thing over  for they say every body is in love once in their lives  and i shall have been let off easily    when his letter to mrs  weston arrived  emma had the perusal of it  and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations  and think she had undervalued their strength   it was a long  well written letter  giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings  expressing all the affection  gratitude  and respect which was natural and honourable  and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive  with spirit and precision  no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern  it was the language of real feeling towards mrs  weston  and the transition from highbury to enscombe  the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt  and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety   the charm of her own name was not wanting    miss   woodhouse  appeared more than once  and never without a something of pleasing connexion  either a compliment to her taste  or a remembrance of what she had said  and in the very last time of its meeting her eye  unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry  she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed   compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words   i had not a spare moment on tuesday  as you know  for miss woodhouse  beautiful little friend   pray make my excuses and adieus to her    this  emma could not doubt  was all for herself   harriet was remembered only from being  her  friend  his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated  mrs  churchill was recovering  and he dared not yet  even in his own imagination  fix a time for coming to randalls again   gratifying  however  and stimulative as was the letter in the material part  its sentiments  she yet found  when it was folded up and returned to mrs  weston  that it had not added any lasting warmth  that she could still do without the writer  and that he must learn to do without her   her intentions were unchanged   her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness   his recollection of harriet  and the words which clothed it  the  beautiful little friend   suggested to her the idea of harriet  succeeding her in his affections  was it impossible   no   harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding  but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner  and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour   for harriet  it would be advantageous and delightful indeed    i must not dwell upon it   said she    i must not think of it  i know the danger of indulging such speculations   but stranger things have happened  and when we cease to care for each other as we do now  it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure    it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet  behalf  though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom  for evil in that quarter was at hand   as frank churchill  arrival had succeeded mr  elton  engagement in the conversation of highbury  as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first  so now upon frank churchill  disappearance  mr  elton  concerns were assuming the most irresistible form   his wedding day was named  he would soon be among them again  mr  elton and his bride  there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before  mr  elton and his bride  was in every body  mouth  and frank churchill was forgotten   emma grew sick at the sound  she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr  elton  and harriet  mind  she had been willing to hope  had been lately gaining strength   with mr  weston  ball in view at least  there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things  but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach  new carriage  bell ringing  and all   poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give   emma felt that she could not do too much for her  that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience  but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect  for ever agreed to  without being able to make their opinions the same   harriet listened submissively  and said  it was very true   it was just as miss woodhouse described  it was not worth while to think about them  and she would not think about them any longer  but no change of subject could avail  and the next half hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before  at last emma attacked her on another ground    your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr  elton  marrying  harriet  is the strongest reproach you can make  me    you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into   it was all my doing  i know   i have not forgotten it  i assure you   deceived myself  i did very miserably deceive you   and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever   do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it    harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation   emma continued    i have not said  exert yourself harriet for my sake  think less  talk less of mr  elton for my sake  because for your own sake rather  i would wish it to be done  for the sake of what is more important than my comfort  a habit of self command in you  a consideration of what is your duty  an attention to propriety  an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others  to save your health and credit  and restore your tranquillity   these are the motives which i have been pressing on you   they are very important  and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them  my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration   i want you to save yourself from greater pain   perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due  or rather what would be kind by me    this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest  the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse  whom she really loved extremely  made her wretched for a while  and when the violence of grief was comforted away  still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably    you  who have been the best friend i ever had in my life   want gratitude to you!  nobody is equal to you!  i care for nobody as i do for you!  oh!  miss woodhouse  how ungrateful i have been!   such expressions  assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do  made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well  nor valued her affection so highly before    there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart   said she afterwards to herself    there is nothing to be compared to it  warmth and tenderness of heart  with an affectionate  open manner  will beat all the clearness of head in the world  for attraction  i am sure it will   it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved  which gives isabella all her popularity    i have it not  but i know how to prize and respect it   harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives  dear harriet!  i would not change you for the clearest headed  longest sighted  best judging female breathing   oh! the coldness of a jane fairfax!  harriet is worth a hundred such  and for a wife   a sensible man  wife  it is invaluable   i mention no names  but happy the man who changes emma for harriet!     chapter xiv   mrs  elton was first seen at church   but though devotion might be interrupted  curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew  and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid  to settle whether she were very pretty indeed  or only rather pretty  or not pretty at all   emma had feelings  less of curiosity than of pride or propriety  to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects  and she made a point of harriet  going with her  that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible   she could not enter the house again  could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago  to lace up her boot  without  recollecting    a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur   compliments  charades  and horrible blunders  and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too  but she behaved very well  and was only rather pale and silent   the visit was of course short  and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it  that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady  and on no account to give one  beyond the nothing meaning terms of being  elegantly dressed  and very pleasing    she did not really like her   she would not be in a hurry to find fault  but she suspected that there was no elegance   ease  but not elegance    she was almost sure that for a young woman  a stranger  a bride  there was too much ease   her person was rather good  her face not unpretty  but neither feature  nor air  nor voice  nor manner  were elegant   emma thought at least it would turn out so   as for mr  elton  his manners did not appear  but no  she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners  it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits  and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it  the woman was better off  she might have the assistance of fine clothes  and the privilege of bashfulness  but the man had only his own good sense to depend on  and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr  elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married  the woman he had wanted to marry  and the woman whom he had been expected to marry  she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise  and to be as much affectedly  and as little really easy as could be    well  miss woodhouse   said harriet  when they had quitted the house  and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin   well  miss woodhouse   with a gentle sigh   what do you think of her    is not she very charming    there was a little hesitation in emma  answer    oh! yes  very  a very pleasing young woman     i think her beautiful  quite beautiful     very nicely dressed  indeed  a remarkably elegant gown     i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love     oh! no  there is nothing to surprize one at all   a pretty fortune  and she came in his way     i dare say   returned harriet  sighing again   i dare say she was very much attached to him     perhaps she might  but it is not every man  fate to marry the woman who loves him best   miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home  and thought this the best offer she was likely to have     yes   said harriet earnestly   and well she might  nobody could ever have a better   well  i wish them happy with all my heart   and now  miss woodhouse  i do not think i shall mind seeing them again  he is just as superior as ever   but being married  you know  it is quite a different thing   no  indeed  miss woodhouse  you need not be afraid  i can sit and admire him now without any great misery  to know that he has not thrown himself away  is such a comfort!   she does seem a charming young woman  just what he deserves  happy creature!  he called her `augusta '  how delightful!   when the visit was returned  emma made up her mind   she could then see more and judge better   from harriet  happening not to be at hartfield  and her father  being present to engage mr  elton  she had a quarter of an hour of the lady  conversation to herself  and could composedly attend to her  and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs  elton was a vain woman  extremely well satisfied with herself  and thinking much of her own importance  that she meant to shine and be very superior  but with manners which had been formed in a bad school  pert and familiar  that all her notions were drawn from one set of people  and one style of living  that if not foolish she was ignorant  and that her society would certainly do mr  elton no good   harriet would have been a better match   if not wise or refined herself  she would have connected him with those who were  but miss hawkins  it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit  had been the best of her own set   the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride of the alliance  and his place and his carriages were the pride of him   the very first subject after being seated was maple grove   my brother mr  suckling  seat    a comparison of hartfield to maple grove  the grounds of hartfield were small  but neat and pretty  and the house was modern and well built  mrs  elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room  the entrance  and all that she could see or imagine    very like maple grove indeed!  she was quite struck by the likeness!  that room was the very shape and size of the morning room at maple grove  her sister  favourite room     mr  elton was appealed to    was not it astonishingly like    she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove     and the staircase  you know  as i came in  i observed how very like the staircase was  placed exactly in the same part of the house  i really could not help exclaiming!  i assure you  miss woodhouse  it is very delightful to me  to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove   i have spent so many happy months there!  with a little sigh of sentiment   a charming place  undoubtedly   every body who sees it is struck by its beauty  but to me  it has been quite a home   whenever you are transplanted  like me  miss woodhouse  you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind  i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony    emma made as slight a reply as she could  but it was fully sufficient for mrs  elton  who only wanted to be talking herself    so extremely like maple grove!  and it is not merely the house   the grounds  i assure you  as far as i could observe  are strikingly like   the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here  and stand very much in the same way  just across the lawn  and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree  with a bench round it  which put me so exactly in mind!  my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place   people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style    emma doubted the truth of this sentiment   she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else  but it was not worth while to attack an error so double dyed  and therefore only said in reply    when you have seen more of this country  i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield   surry is full of beauties     oh! yes  i am quite aware of that   it is the garden of england  you know   surry is the garden of england     yes  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction  many counties  i believe  are called the garden of england  as well as surry     no  i fancy not   replied mrs  elton  with a most satisfied smile   i never heard any county but surry called so    emma was silenced    my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring  or summer at farthest   continued mrs  elton   and that will be our time for exploring   while they are with us  we shall explore a great deal  i dare say   they will have their barouche landau  of course  which holds four perfectly  and therefore  without saying any thing of  our  carriage  we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well   they would hardly come in their chaise  i think  at that season of the year   indeed  when the time draws on  i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau  it will be so very much preferable   when people come into a beautiful country of this sort  you know  miss woodhouse  one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible  and mr  suckling is extremely fond of exploring   we explored to king  weston twice last summer  in that way  most delightfully  just after their first having the barouche landau   you have many parties of that kind here  i suppose  miss woodhouse  every summer     no  not immediately here   we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of  and we are a very quiet set of people  i believe  more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure     ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort  nobody can be more devoted to home than i am   i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove   many a time has selina said  when she has been going to bristol  `i really cannot get this girl to move from the house   i absolutely must go in by myself  though i hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion  but augusta  i believe  with her own good will  would never stir beyond the park paling '  many a time has she said so  and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion   i think  on the contrary  when people shut themselves up entirely from society  it is a very bad thing  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree  without living in it either too much or too little  i perfectly understand your situation  however  miss woodhouse    looking towards mr  woodhouse   your father  state of health must be a great drawback   why does not he try bath   indeed he should  let me recommend bath to you   i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr  woodhouse good     my father tried it more than once  formerly  but without receiving any benefit  and mr  perry  whose name  i dare say  is not unknown to you  does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now     ah! that  a great pity  for i assure you  miss woodhouse  where the waters do agree  it is quite wonderful the relief they give   in my bath life  i have seen such instances of it! and it is so cheerful a place  that it could not fail of being of use to mr  woodhouse  spirits  which  i understand  are sometimes much depressed   and as to its recommendations to  you   i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them   the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood   it would be a charming introduction for you  who have lived so secluded a life  and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place  a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance  and my particular friend  mrs  partridge  the lady i have always resided with when in bath  would be most happy to shew you any attentions  and would be the very person for you to go into public with    it was as much as emma could bear  without being impolite  the idea of her being indebted to mrs  elton for what was called an  introduction   of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs  elton   probably some vulgar  dashing widow  who  with the help of a boarder  just made a shift to live!   the dignity of miss woodhouse  of hartfield  was sunk indeed!  she restrained herself  however  from any of the reproofs she could have given  and only thanked mrs  elton coolly   but their going to bath was quite out of the question  and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father   and then  to prevent farther outrage and indignation  changed the subject directly    i do not ask whether you are musical  mrs  elton   upon these occasions  a lady  character generally precedes her  and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer     oh! no  indeed  i must protest against any such idea  a superior performer!  very far from it  i assure you  consider from how partial a quarter your information came  i am doatingly fond of music  passionately fond   and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste  but as to any thing else  upon my honour my performance is  mediocre  to the last degree  you  miss woodhouse  i well know  play delightfully   i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction  comfort  and delight to me  to hear what a musical society i am got into   i absolutely cannot do without music   it is a necessary of life to me  and having always been used to a very musical society  both at maple grove and in bath  it would have been a most serious sacrifice   i honestly said as much to mr  e  when he was speaking of my future home  and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable  and the inferiority of the house too  knowing what i had been accustomed to  of course he was not wholly without apprehension  when he was speaking of it in that way  i honestly said that  the   world  i could give up  parties  balls  plays  for i had no fear of retirement   blessed with so many resources within myself  the world was not necessary to  me    i could do very well without it  to those who had no resources it was a different thing  but my resources made me quite independent   and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to  i really could not give it a thought  i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description  certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove  but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness  nor were spacious apartments   `but ' said i  `to be quite honest  i do not think i can live without something of a musical society  i condition for nothing else  but without music  life would be a blank to me '    we cannot suppose   said emma  smiling   that mr  elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a  very  musical society in highbury  and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned  in consideration of the motive     no  indeed  i have no doubts at all on that head   i am delighted to find myself in such a circle   i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together   i think  miss woodhouse  you and i must establish a musical club  and have regular weekly meetings at your house  or ours   will not it be a good plan   if  we  exert ourselves  i think we shall not be long in want of allies  something of that nature would be particularly desirable for  me   as an inducement to keep me in practice  for married women  you know   there is a sad story against them  in general   they are but too apt to give up music     but you  who are so extremely fond of it  there can be no danger  surely     i should hope not  but really when i look around among my acquaintance  i tremble   selina has entirely given up music  never touches the instrument  though she played sweetly   and the same may be said of mrs  jeffereys  clara partridge  that was  and of the two milmans  now mrs  bird and mrs  james cooper  and of more than i can enumerate  upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright   i used to be quite angry with selina  but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention  i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper     but every thing of that kind   said emma   will soon be in so regular a train      well   said mrs  elton  laughing   we shall see    emma  finding her so determined upon neglecting her music  had nothing more to say  and  after a moment  pause  mrs  elton chose another subject    we have been calling at randalls   said she   and found them both at home  and very pleasant people they seem to be  i like them extremely   mr  weston seems an excellent creature   quite a first rate favourite with me already  i assure you  and  she  appears so truly good  there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her  that it wins upon one directly  she was your governess  i think    emma was almost too much astonished to answer  but mrs  elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on    having understood as much  i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like!  but she is really quite the gentlewoman     mrs  weston  manners   said emma   were always particularly good  their propriety  simplicity  and elegance  would make them the safest model for any young woman     and who do you think came in while we were there    emma was quite at a loss   the tone implied some old acquaintance   and how could she possibly guess    knightley!  continued mrs  elton   knightley himself!  was not it lucky   for  not being within when he called the other day  i had never seen him before  and of course  as so particular a friend of mr  e    i had a great curiosity   `my friend knightley' had been so often mentioned  that i was really impatient to see him  and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend   knightley is quite the gentleman  i like him very much   decidedly  i think  a very gentleman like man    happily  it was now time to be gone   they were off  and emma could breathe    insufferable woman!  was her immediate exclamation    worse than i had supposed   absolutely insufferable!  knightley!  i could not have believed it   knightley!  never seen him in her life before  and call him knightley!  and discover that he is a gentleman! a little upstart  vulgar being  with her mr  e   and her  caro   sposo   and her resources  and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery   actually to discover that mr  knightley is a gentleman!  i doubt whether he will return the compliment  and discover her to be a lady   i could not have believed it! and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club! one would fancy we were bosom friends!  and mrs  weston!   astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman!  worse and worse   i never met with her equal  much beyond my hopes   harriet is disgraced by any comparison  oh! what would frank churchill say to her  if he were here  how angry and how diverted he would be!  ah! there i am   thinking of him directly   always the first person to be thought of! how i catch myself out!  frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind!     all this ran so glibly through her thoughts  that by the time her father had arranged himself  after the bustle of the eltons' departure  and was ready to speak  she was very tolerably capable of attending    well  my dear   he deliberately began   considering we never saw her before  she seems a very pretty sort of young lady  and i dare say she was very much pleased with you   she speaks a little too quick  a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear  but i believe i am nice  i do not like strange voices  and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor   however  she seems a very obliging  pretty behaved young lady  and no doubt will make him a very good wife  though i think he had better not have married   i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs  elton on this happy occasion  i said that i hoped i  should  in the course of the summer   but i ought to have gone before   not to wait upon a bride is very remiss   ah! it shews what a sad invalid i am! but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane     i dare say your apologies were accepted  sir   mr  elton knows you     yes   but a young lady  a bride  i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible   it was being very deficient     but  my dear papa  you are no friend to matrimony  and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a  bride   it ought to be no recommendation to  you    it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them     no  my dear  i never encouraged any body to marry  but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady  and a bride  especially  is never to be neglected   more is avowedly due to  her   a bride  you know  my dear  is always the first in company  let the others be who they may     well  papa  if this is not encouragement to marry  i do not know what is   and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies     my dear  you do not understand me   this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding  and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry    emma had done   her father was growing nervous  and could not understand  her    her mind returned to mrs  elton  offences  and long  very long  did they occupy her     chapter xv   emma was not required  by any subsequent discovery  to retract her ill opinion of mrs  elton   her observation had been pretty correct  such as mrs  elton appeared to her on this second interview  such she appeared whenever they met again   self important  presuming  familiar  ignorant  and ill bred  she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment  but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world  to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood  and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs  elton  consequence only could surpass   there was no reason to suppose mr  elton thought at all differently from his wife   he seemed not merely happy with her  but proud  he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury  as not even miss woodhouse could equal  and the greater part of her new acquaintance  disposed to commend  or not in the habit of judging  following the lead of miss bates  good will  or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself  were very well satisfied  so that mrs  elton  praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do  unimpeded by miss woodhouse  who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being  very pleasant and very elegantly dressed    in one respect mrs  elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first   her feelings altered towards emma   offended  probably  by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with  she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant  and though the effect was agreeable  the ill will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma  dislike  her manners  too  and mr  elton   were unpleasant towards harriet  they were sneering and negligent   emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet  cure  but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much   it was not to be doubted that poor harriet  attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve  and her own share in the story  under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him  had in all likelihood been given also   she was  of course  the object of their joint dislike    when they had nothing else to say  it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse  and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her  found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet   mrs  elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax  and from the first  not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other  but from the very first  and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration   but without solicitation  or plea  or privilege  she must be wanting to assist and befriend her   before emma had forfeited her confidence  and about the third time of their meeting  she heard all mrs  elton  knight errantry on the subject      jane fairfax is absolutely charming  miss woodhouse   i quite rave about jane fairfax   a sweet  interesting creature   so mild and ladylike  and with such talents!  i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents   i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well   i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point   oh! she is absolutely charming!  you will laugh at my warmth  but  upon my word  i talk of nothing but jane fairfax    and her situation is so calculated to affect one!  miss woodhouse  we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her  we must bring her forward   such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown   i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet           `full many a flower is born to blush unseen            `and waste its fragrance on the desert air '  we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax     i cannot think there is any danger of it   was emma  calm answer    and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax  situation and understand what her home has been  with colonel and mrs  campbell  i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown     oh! but dear miss woodhouse  she is now in such retirement  such obscurity  so thrown away   whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end!  and i think she feels it   i am sure she does   she is very timid and silent  one can see that she feels the want of encouragement   i like her the better for it   i must confess it is a recommendation to me  i am a great advocate for timidity  and i am sure one does not often meet with it   but in those who are at all inferior  it is extremely prepossessing   oh!  i assure you  jane fairfax is a very delightful character  and interests me more than i can express     you appear to feel a great deal  but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax  acquaintance here  any of those who have known her longer than yourself  can shew her any other attention than      my dear miss woodhouse  a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act   you and i need not be afraid   if  we  set the example  many will follow it as far as they can  though all have not our situations    we  have carriages to fetch and convey her home  and  we  live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax  at any time  the least inconvenient   i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner  as could make me regret having asked  more  than jane fairfax to partake of it   i have no idea of that sort of thing   it is not likely that i  should   considering what i have been used to  my greatest danger  perhaps  in housekeeping  may be quite the other way  in doing too much  and being too careless of expense  maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be   for we do not at all affect to equal my brother  mr  suckling  in income   however  my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax    i shall certainly have her very often at my house  shall introduce her wherever i can  shall have musical parties to draw out her talents  and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation  my acquaintance is so very extensive  that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly   i shall introduce her  of course  very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us   i am sure they will like her extremely  and when she gets a little acquainted with them  her fears will completely wear off  for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating   i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me  and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties     poor jane fairfax!   thought emma    you have not deserved this  you may have done wrong with regard to mr  dixon  but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!  the kindness and protection of mrs  elton!  `jane fairfax and jane fairfax '  heavens!  let me not suppose that she dares go about  emma woodhouse ing me!   but upon my honour  there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman  tongue!   emma had not to listen to such paradings again  to any so exclusively addressed to herself  so disgustingly decorated with a  dear miss woodhouse    the change on mrs  elton  side soon afterwards appeared  and she was left in peace  neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs  elton  nor  under mrs  elton  guidance  the very active patroness of jane fairfax  and only sharing with others in a general way  in knowing what was felt  what was meditated  what was done   she looked on with some amusement   miss bates  gratitude for mrs  elton  attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth   she was quite one of her worthies   the most amiable  affable  delightful woman  just as accomplished and condescending as mrs  elton meant to be considered  emma  only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs  elton as she seemed to do  she heard of her walking with the eltons  sitting with the eltons  spending a day with the eltons!  this was astonishing!  she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer    she is a riddle  quite a riddle!  said she    to chuse to remain here month after month  under privations of every sort!  and now to chuse the mortification of mrs  elton  notice and the penury of her conversation  rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real  generous affection    jane had come to highbury professedly for three months  the campbells were gone to ireland for three months  but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer  and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there  according to miss bates  it all came from her  mrs  dixon had written most pressingly   would jane but go  means were to be found  servants sent  friends contrived  no travelling difficulty allowed to exist  but still she had declined it!   she must have some motive  more powerful than appears  for refusing this invitation   was emma  conclusion    she must be under some sort of penance  inflicted either by the campbells or herself  there is great fear  great caution  great resolution somewhere    she is  not  to be with the  dixons    the decree is issued by somebody  but why must she consent to be with the eltons   here is quite a separate puzzle    upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject  before the few who knew her opinion of mrs  elton  mrs  weston ventured this apology for jane    we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage  my dear emma  but it is better than being always at home  her aunt is a good creature  but  as a constant companion  must be very tiresome   we must consider what miss fairfax quits  before we condemn her taste for what she goes to     you are right  mrs  weston   said mr  knightley warmly   miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs  elton  could she have chosen with whom to associate  she would not have chosen her   but  with a reproachful smile at emma  she receives attentions from mrs  elton  which nobody else pays her    emma felt that mrs  weston was giving her a momentary glance  and she was herself struck by his warmth   with a faint blush  she presently replied    such attentions as mrs  elton   i should have imagined  would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax   mrs  elton  invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting     i should not wonder   said mrs  weston   if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination  by her aunt  eagerness in accepting mrs  elton  civilities for her   poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated  in spite of the very natural wish of a little change    both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again  and after a few minutes silence  he said    another thing must be taken into consideration too  mrs  elton does not talk  to  miss fairfax as she speaks  of  her   we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou  the plainest spoken amongst us  we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other   a something more early implanted   we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before  we feel things differently   and besides the operation of this  as a general principle  you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs  elton by her superiority both of mind and manner  and that  face to face  mrs  elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to   such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs  elton  way before  and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action  if not in consciousness     i know how highly you think of jane fairfax   said emma  little henry was in her thoughts  and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say    yes   he replied   any body may know how highly i think of her     and yet   said emma  beginning hastily and with an arch look  but soon stopping  it was better  however  to know the worst at once   she hurried on   and yet  perhaps  you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is   the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other    mr  knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters  and either the exertion of getting them together  or some other cause  brought the colour into his face  as he answered    oh! are you there   but you are miserably behindhand   mr  cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago    he stopped   emma felt her foot pressed by mrs  weston  and did not herself know what to think   in a moment he went on     that will never be  however  i can assure you   miss fairfax  i dare say  would not have me if i were to ask her  and i am very sure i shall never ask her    emma returned her friend  pressure with interest  and was pleased enough to exclaim    you are not vain  mr  knightley   i will say that for you    he seemed hardly to hear her  he was thoughtful  and in a manner which shewed him not pleased  soon afterwards said    so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax     no indeed i have not   you have scolded me too much for match making  for me to presume to take such a liberty with you   what i said just now  meant nothing   one says those sort of things  of course  without any idea of a serious meaning   oh! no  upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body  you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way  if you were married    mr  knightley was thoughtful again   the result of his reverie was   no  emma  i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize   i never had a thought of her in that way  i assure you    and soon afterwards   jane fairfax is a very charming young woman  but not even jane fairfax is perfect   she has a fault  she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife    emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault   well   said she   and you soon silenced mr  cole  i suppose     yes  very soon   he gave me a quiet hint  i told him he was mistaken  he asked my pardon and said no more   cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours     in that respect how unlike dear mrs  elton  who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world!  i wonder how she speaks of the coles   what she calls them!  how can she find any appellation for them  deep enough in familiar vulgarity   she calls you  knightley  what can she do for mr  cole   and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her  mrs  weston  your argument weighs most with me   i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates  than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax  mind over mrs  elton   i have no faith in mrs  elton  acknowledging herself the inferior in thought  word  or deed  or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding  i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise  encouragement  and offers of service  that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions  from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau     jane fairfax has feeling   said mr  knightley   i do not accuse her of want of feeling   her sensibilities  i suspect  are strong  and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance  patience  self controul  but it wants openness   she is reserved  more reserved  i think  than she used to be  and i love an open temper   no  till cole alluded to my supposed attachment  it had never entered my head   i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her  with admiration and pleasure always  but with no thought beyond     well  mrs  weston   said emma triumphantly when he left them   what do you say now to mr  knightley  marrying jane fairfax     why  really  dear emma  i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of  not  being in love with her  that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last   do not beat me      chapter xvi   every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr  elton  was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage   dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady  and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day    i see how it is   said she    i see what a life i am to lead among you   upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated  we really seem quite the fashion   if this is living in the country  it is nothing very formidable   from monday next to saturday  i assure you we have not a disengaged day!  a woman with fewer resources than i have  need not have been at a loss    no invitation came amiss to her   her bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her  and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners   she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms  at the poor attempt at rout cakes  and there being no ice in the highbury card parties  mrs  bates  mrs  perry  mrs  goddard and others  were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world  but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged   in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party  in which her card tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style  and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish  to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour  and in the proper order   emma  in the meanwhile  could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons   they must not do less than others  or she should be exposed to odious suspicions  and imagined capable of pitiful resentment   a dinner there must be   after emma had talked about it for ten minutes  mr  woodhouse felt no unwillingness  and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself  with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him   the persons to be invited  required little thought   besides the eltons  it must be the westons and mr  knightley  so far it was all of course   and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth   but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction  and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet  begging to be allowed to decline it   she would rather not be in his company more than she could help  she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together  without feeling uncomfortable   if miss woodhouse would not be displeased  she would rather stay at home   it was precisely what emma would have wished  had she deemed it possible enough for wishing   she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend  for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home  and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth  jane fairfax    since her last conversation with mrs  weston and mr  knightley  she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been   mr  knightley  words dwelt with her   he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs  elton which nobody else paid her    this is very true   said she   at least as far as relates to me  which was all that was meant  and it is very shameful   of the same age   and always knowing her  i ought to have been more her friend    she will never like me now   i have neglected her too long   but i will shew her greater attention than i have done    every invitation was successful   they were all disengaged and all happy    the preparatory interest of this dinner  however  was not yet over  a circumstance rather unlucky occurred   the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring  and their papa now proposed bringing them  and staying one whole day at hartfield  which one day would be the very day of this party   his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off  but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so   mr  woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear   and here would be a ninth  and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party   she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself  by representing that though he certainly would make them nine  yet he always said so little  that the increase of noise would be very immaterial   she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself  to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother   the event was more favourable to mr  woodhouse than to emma  john knightley came  but mr  weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day   he might be able to join them in the evening  but certainly not to dinner   mr  woodhouse was quite at ease  and the seeing him so  with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate  removed the chief of even emma  vexation   the day came  the party were punctually assembled  and mr  john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable  instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner  he was talking to miss fairfax   mrs  elton  as elegant as lace and pearls could make her  he looked at in silence   wanting only to observe enough for isabella  information  but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl  and he could talk to her   he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys  when it had been just beginning to rain   it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject  and he said    i hope you did not venture far  miss fairfax  this morning  or i am sure you must have been wet   we scarcely got home in time  i hope you turned directly     i went only to the post office   said she   and reached home before the rain was much   it is my daily errand   i always fetch the letters when i am here   it saves trouble  and is a something to get me out   a walk before breakfast does me good     not a walk in the rain  i should imagine     no  but it did not absolutely rain when i set out    mr  john knightley smiled  and replied    that is to say  you chose to have your walk  for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you  and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before  the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives  when you have lived to my age  you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for    there was a little blush  and then this answer    i must not hope to be ever situated as you are  in the midst of every dearest connexion  and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters     indifferent!  oh! no  i never conceived you could become indifferent  letters are no matter of indifference  they are generally a very positive curse     you are speaking of letters of business  mine are letters of friendship     i have often thought them the worst of the two   replied he coolly   business  you know  may bring money  but friendship hardly ever does     ah! you are not serious now   i know mr  john knightley too well   i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body   i can easily believe that letters are very little to you  much less than to me  but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference  it is not age  but situation  you have every body dearest to you always at hand  i  probably  never shall again  and therefore till i have outlived all my affections  a post office  i think  must always have power to draw me out  in worse weather than to day     when i talked of your being altered by time  by the progress of years   said john knightley   i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings   i consider one as including the other  time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle  but that is not the change i had in view for you  as an old friend  you will allow me to hope  miss fairfax  that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have    it was kindly said  and very far from giving offence   a pleasant  thank you  seemed meant to laugh it off  but a blush  a quivering lip  a tear in the eye  shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh  her attention was now claimed by mr  woodhouse  who being  according to his custom on such occasions  making the circle of his guests  and paying his particular compliments to the ladies  was ending with her  and with all his mildest urbanity  said    i am very sorry to hear  miss fairfax  of your being out this morning in the rain   young ladies should take care of themselves    young ladies are delicate plants   they should take care of their health and their complexion   my dear  did you change your stockings     yes  sir  i did indeed  and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me     my dear miss fairfax  young ladies are very sure to be cared for    i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well   they are some of my very old friends   i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour   you do us a great deal of honour to day  i am sure  my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness  and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield    the kind hearted  polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty  and made every fair lady welcome and easy   by this time  the walk in the rain had reached mrs  elton  and her remonstrances now opened upon jane    my dear jane  what is this i hear   going to the post office in the rain!  this must not be  i assure you   you sad girl  how could you do such a thing   it is a sign i was not there to take care of you    jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold    oh! do not tell  me    you really are a very sad girl  and do not know how to take care of yourself   to the post office indeed! mrs  weston  did you ever hear the like   you and i must positively exert our authority     my advice   said mrs  weston kindly and persuasively   i certainly do feel tempted to give   miss fairfax  you must not run such risks    liable as you have been to severe colds  indeed you ought to be particularly careful  especially at this time of year  the spring i always think requires more than common care  better wait an hour or two  or even half a day for your letters  than run the risk of bringing on your cough again   now do not you feel that you had   yes  i am sure you are much too reasonable  you look as if you would not do such a thing again     oh! she  shall   not  do such a thing again   eagerly rejoined mrs  elton    we will not allow her to do such a thing again     and nodding significantly   there must be some arrangement made  there must indeed   i shall speak to mr  e  the man who fetches our letters every morning  one of our men  i forget his name  shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you   that will obviate all difficulties you know  and from  us  i really think  my dear jane  you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation     you are extremely kind   said jane   but i cannot give up my early walk   i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can  i must walk somewhere  and the post office is an object  and upon my word  i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before     my dear jane  say no more about it   the thing is determined  that is  laughing affectedly  as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master   you know  mrs  weston  you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves  but i do flatter myself  my dear jane  that my influence is not entirely worn out   if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore  consider that point as settled     excuse me   said jane earnestly   i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement  so needlessly troublesome to your servant  if the errand were not a pleasure to me  it could be done  as it always is when i am not here  by my grandmama      oh! my dear  but so much as patty has to do!  and it is a kindness to employ our men    jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered  but instead of answering  she began speaking again to mr  john knightley    the post office is a wonderful establishment!  said she     the regularity and despatch of it!  if one thinks of all that it has to do  and all that it does so well  it is really astonishing!    it is certainly very well regulated     so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  so seldom that a letter  among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom  is even carried wrong  and not one in a million  i suppose  actually lost!  and when one considers the variety of hands  and of bad hands too  that are to be deciphered  it increases the wonder     the clerks grow expert from habit   they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand  and exercise improves them   if you want any farther explanation   continued he  smiling   they are paid for it   that is the key to a great deal of capacity  the public pays and must be served well    the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of  and the usual observations made    i have heard it asserted   said john knightley   that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family  and where the same master teaches  it is natural enough   but for that reason  i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females  for boys have very little teaching after an early age  and scramble into any hand they can get   isabella and emma  i think  do write very much alike   i have not always known their writing apart     yes   said his brother hesitatingly   there is a likeness  i know what you mean  but emma  hand is the strongest     isabella and emma both write beautifully   said mr  woodhouse   and always did   and so does poor mrs  weston   with half a sigh and half a smile at her    i never saw any gentleman  handwriting   emma began  looking also at mrs  weston  but stopped  on perceiving that mrs  weston was attending to some one else  and the pause gave her time to reflect   now  how am i going to introduce him   am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people   is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase   your yorkshire friend   your correspondent in yorkshire   that would be the way  i suppose  if i were very bad   no  i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress   i certainly get better and better   now for it    mrs  weston was disengaged and emma began again   mr  frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman  hands i ever saw     i do not admire it   said mr  knightley    it is too small   wants strength   it is like a woman  writing    this was not submitted to by either lady   they vindicated him against the base aspersion    no  it by no means wanted strength   it was not a large hand  but very clear and certainly strong  had not mrs  weston any letter about her to produce    no  she had heard from him very lately  but having answered the letter  had put it away    if we were in the other room   said emma   if i had my writing desk  i am sure i could produce a specimen   i have a note of his    do not you remember  mrs  weston  employing him to write for you one day     he chose to say he was employed      well  well  i have that note  and can shew it after dinner to convince mr  knightley     oh! when a gallant young man  like mr  frank churchill   said mr  knightley dryly   writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse  he will  of course  put forth his best    dinner was on table   mrs  elton  before she could be spoken to  was ready  and before mr  woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour  was saying     must i go first   i really am ashamed of always leading the way    jane  solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma  she had heard and seen it all  and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any   she suspected that it  had   that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear  and that it had not been in vain   she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual  a glow both of complexion and spirits   she could have made an inquiry or two  as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails   it was at her tongue  end   but she abstained   she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax  feelings  and they followed the other ladies out of the room  arm in arm  with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each     chapter xvii   when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner  emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties    with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs  elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself   she and mrs  weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together  mrs  elton left them no choice   if jane repressed her for a little time  she soon began again  and though much that passed between them was in a half whisper  especially on mrs  elton  side  there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects  the post office  catching cold  fetching letters  and friendship  were long under discussion  and to them succeeded one  which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane  inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her  and professions of mrs  elton  meditated activity    here is april come!  said she   i get quite anxious about you  june will soon be here     but i have never fixed on june or any other month  merely looked forward to the summer in general     but have you really heard of nothing     i have not even made any inquiry  i do not wish to make any yet     oh! my dear  we cannot begin too early  you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing     i not aware!  said jane  shaking her head   dear mrs  elton  who can have thought of it as i have done     but you have not seen so much of the world as i have   you do not know how many candidates there always are for the  first  situations  i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove  a cousin of mr  suckling  mrs  bragge  had such an infinity of applications  every body was anxious to be in her family  for she moves in the first circle   wax candles in the schoolroom! you may imagine how desirable!  of all houses in the kingdom mrs  bragge  is the one i would most wish to see you in     colonel and mrs  campbell are to be in town again by midsummer   said jane    i must spend some time with them  i am sure they will want it   afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself  but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present     trouble! aye  i know your scruples   you are afraid of giving me trouble  but i assure you  my dear jane  the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am   i shall write to mrs  partridge in a day or two  and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible     thank you  but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her  till the time draws nearer  i do not wish to be giving any body trouble     but  my dear child  the time is drawing near  here is april  and june  or say even july  is very near  with such business to accomplish before us   your inexperience really amuses me! a situation such as you deserve  and your friends would require for you  is no everyday occurrence  is not obtained at a moment  notice  indeed  indeed  we must begin inquiring directly     excuse me  ma'am  but this is by no means my intention  i make no inquiry myself  and should be sorry to have any made by my friends  when i am quite determined as to the time  i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed   there are places in town  offices  where inquiry would soon produce something  offices for the sale   not quite of human flesh  but of human intellect     oh! my dear  human flesh!  you quite shock me  if you mean a fling at the slave trade  i assure you mr  suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition     i did not mean  i was not thinking of the slave trade   replied jane   governess trade  i assure you  was all that i had in view  widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on  but as to the greater misery of the victims  i do not know where it lies   but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices  and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do     something that would do!  repeated mrs  elton    aye   that  may suit your humble ideas of yourself   i know what a modest creature you are  but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer  any inferior  commonplace situation  in a family not moving in a certain circle  or able to command the elegancies of life     you are very obliging  but as to all that  i am very indifferent  it would be no object to me to be with the rich  my mortifications  i think  would only be the greater  i should suffer more from comparison  a gentleman  family is all that i should condition for     i know you  i know you  you would take up with any thing  but i shall be a little more nice  and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side  with your superior talents  you have a right to move in the first circle   your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms  have as many rooms as you like  and mix in the family as much as you chose   that is  i do not know   if you knew the harp  you might do all that  i am very sure  but you sing as well as play   yes  i really believe you might  even without the harp  stipulate for what you chose   and you must and shall be delightfully  honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest     you may well class the delight  the honour  and the comfort of such a situation together   said jane   they are pretty sure to be equal  however  i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me   i am exceedingly obliged to you  mrs  elton  i am obliged to any body who feels for me  but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer  for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am  and as i am     and i am quite serious too  i assure you   replied mrs  elton gaily   in resolving to be always on the watch  and employing my friends to watch also  that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us    in this style she ran on  never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr  woodhouse came into the room  her vanity had then a change of object  and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane    here comes this dear old beau of mine  i protest!  only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!  what a dear creature he is   i assure you i like him excessively   i admire all that quaint  old fashioned politeness  it is much more to my taste than modern ease  modern ease often disgusts me   but this good old mr  woodhouse  i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner   oh!  i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous  i fancy i am rather a favourite  he took notice of my gown  how do you like it   selina  choice  handsome  i think  but i do not know whether it is not over trimmed  i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed  quite a horror of finery  i must put on a few ornaments now  because it is expected of me  a bride  you know  must appear like a bride  but my natural taste is all for simplicity  a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery   but i am quite in the minority  i believe  few people seem to value simplicity of dress   show and finery are every thing   i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin   do you think it will look well    the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when mr  weston made his appearance among them   he had returned to a late dinner  and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over  he had been too much expected by the best judges  for surprize   but there was great joy   mr  woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now  as he would have been sorry to see him before   john knightley only was in mute astonishment   that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london  should set off again  and walk half a mile to another man  house  for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time  of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers  was a circumstance to strike him deeply   a man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning  and might now have been still  who had been long talking  and might have been silent  who had been in more than one crowd  and might have been alone!  such a man  to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside  and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world!  could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife  there would have been a motive  but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party   john knightley looked at him with amazement  then shrugged his shoulders  and said   i could not have believed it even of  him     mr  weston meanwhile  perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting  happy and cheerful as usual  and with all the right of being principal talker  which a day spent anywhere from home confers  was making himself agreeable among the rest  and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner  convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten  and spread abroad what public news he had heard  was proceeding to a family communication  which  though principally addressed to mrs  weston  he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room   he gave her a letter  it was from frank  and to herself  he had met with it in his way  and had taken the liberty of opening it    read it  read it   said he   it will give you pleasure  only a few lines  will not take you long  read it to emma    the two ladies looked over it together  and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time  in a voice a little subdued  but very audible to every body    well  he is coming  you see  good news  i think   well  what do you say to it   i always told you he would be here again soon  did not i   anne  my dear  did not i always tell you so  and you would not believe me   in town next week  you see  at the latest  i dare say  for  she  is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done  most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday  as to her illness  all nothing of course   but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again  so near as town   they will stay a good while when they do come  and he will be half his time with us  this is precisely what i wanted   well  pretty good news  is not it  have you finished it   has emma read it all   put it up  put it up  we will have a good talk about it some other time  but it will not do now   i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way    mrs  weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion  her looks and words had nothing to restrain them   she was happy  she knew she was happy  and knew she ought to be happy  her congratulations were warm and open  but emma could not speak so fluently    she  was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings  and trying to understand the degree of her agitation  which she rather thought was considerable   mr  weston  however  too eager to be very observant  too communicative to want others to talk  was very well satisfied with what she did say  and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already   it was well that he took every body  joy for granted  or he might not have thought either mr  woodhouse or mr  knightley particularly delighted   they were the first entitled  after mrs  weston and emma  to be made happy   from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax  but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley  that it would have been too positive an interruption  and finding himself close to mrs  elton  and her attention disengaged  he necessarily began on the subject with her     chapter xviii    i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you   said mr  weston   mrs  elton  very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope  smiled most graciously    you have heard of a certain frank churchill  i presume   he continued    and know him to be my son  though he does not bear my name     oh! yes  and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance  i am sure mr  elton will lose no time in calling on him  and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage     you are very obliging   frank will be extremely happy  i am sure    he is to be in town next week  if not sooner   we have notice of it in a letter to day  i met the letters in my way this morning  and seeing my son  hand  presumed to open it  though it was not directed to me  it was to mrs  weston   she is his principal correspondent  i assure you   i hardly ever get a letter     and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  oh!  mr  weston    laughing affectedly  i must protest against that   a most dangerous precedent indeed!  i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example   upon my word  if this is what i am to expect  we married women must begin to exert ourselves!  oh!  mr  weston  i could not have believed it of you!    aye  we men are sad fellows   you must take care of yourself  mrs  elton   this letter tells us  it is a short letter  written in a hurry  merely to give us notice  it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly  on mrs  churchill  account  she has not been well the whole winter  and thinks enscombe too cold for her   so they are all to move southward without loss of time     indeed!  from yorkshire  i think   enscombe is in yorkshire     yes  they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london  a considerable journey     yes  upon my word  very considerable   sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london   but what is distance  mr  weston  to people of large fortune   you would be amazed to hear how my brother  mr  suckling  sometimes flies about   you will hardly believe me   but twice in one week he and mr  bragge went to london and back again with four horses     the evil of the distance from enscombe   said mr  weston   is  that mrs  churchill   as   we   understand   has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together   in frank  last letter she complained  he said  of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ! this  you know  speaks a great degree of weakness  but now she is so impatient to be in town  that she means to sleep only two nights on the road   so frank writes word  certainly  delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions  mrs  elton   you must grant me that     no  indeed  i shall grant you nothing   i always take the part of my own sex   i do indeed   i give you notice  you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point   i always stand up for women   and i assure you  if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn  you would not wonder at mrs  churchill  making incredible exertions to avoid it   selina says it is quite horror to her  and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety  she always travels with her own sheets  an excellent precaution  does mrs  churchill do the same     depend upon it  mrs  churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did   mrs  churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for     mrs  elton eagerly interposed with    oh!  mr  weston  do not mistake me   selina is no fine lady  i assure you   do not run away with such an idea     is not she   then she is no rule for mrs  churchill  who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld    mrs  elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly  it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was  not  a fine lady  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it   and she was considering in what way she had best retract  when mr  weston went on    mrs  churchill is not much in my good graces  as you may suspect   but this is quite between ourselves   she is very fond of frank  and therefore i would not speak ill of her   besides  she is out of health now  but  that  indeed  by her own account  she has always been  i would not say so to every body  mrs  elton  but i have not much faith in mrs  churchill  illness     if she is really ill  why not go to bath  mr  weston   to bath  or to clifton     she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her   the fact is  i suppose  that she is tired of enscombe  she has now been a longer time stationary there  than she ever was before  and she begins to want change   it is a retired place  a fine place  but very retired     aye  like maple grove  i dare say   nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove   such an immense plantation all round it! you seem shut out from every thing  in the most complete retirement    and mrs  churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion   or  perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life  i always say a woman cannot have too many resources  and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society     frank was here in february for a fortnight     so i remember to have heard   he will find an  addition  to the society of highbury when he comes again  that is  if i may presume to call myself an addition   but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world    this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by  and mr  weston  with a very good grace  immediately exclaimed    my dear madam!  nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible   not heard of you!  i believe mrs  weston  letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs  elton    he had done his duty and could return to his son    when frank left us   continued he   it was quite uncertain when we might see him again  which makes this day  news doubly welcome  it has been completely unexpected   that is   i  always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon  i was sure something favourable would turn up  but nobody believed me   he and mrs  weston were both dreadfully desponding   `how could he contrive to come  and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ' and so forth  i always felt that something would happen in our favour  and so it has  you see   i have observed  mrs  elton  in the course of my life  that if things are going untowardly one month  they are sure to mend the next     very true  mr  weston  perfectly true   it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship  when  because things did not go quite right  did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings  he was apt to be in despair  and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be  may  before hymen  saffron robe would be put on for us   oh! the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! the carriage  we had disappointments about the carriage   one morning  i remember  he came to me quite in despair    she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing  and mr  weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on    you were mentioning may   may is the very month which mrs  churchill is ordered  or has ordered herself  to spend in some warmer place than enscombe  in short  to spend in london  so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring   precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it   days almost at the longest  weather genial and pleasant  always inviting one out  and never too hot for exercise   when he was here before  we made the best of it  but there was a good deal of wet  damp  cheerless weather  there always is in february  you know  and we could not do half that we intended   now will be the time  this will be complete enjoyment  and i do not know  mrs  elton  whether the uncertainty of our meetings  the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow  and at any hour  may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house   i think it is so   i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight   i hope you will be pleased with my son  but you must not expect a prodigy  he is generally thought a fine young man  but do not expect a prodigy  mrs  weston  partiality for him is very great  and  as you may suppose  most gratifying to me   she thinks nobody equal to him     and i assure you  mr  weston  i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour   i have heard so much in praise of mr  frank churchill   at the same time it is fair to observe  that i am one of those who always judge for themselves  and are by no means implicitly guided by others   i give you notice that as i find your son  so i shall judge of him   i am no flatterer    mr  weston was musing    i hope   said he presently   i have not been severe upon poor mrs  churchill   if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice  but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish  you cannot be ignorant  mrs  elton  of my connexion with the family  nor of the treatment i have met with  and  between ourselves  the whole blame of it is to be laid to her   she was the instigator  frank  mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her  mr  churchill has pride  but his pride is nothing to his wife   his is a quiet  indolent  gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody  and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome  but her pride is arrogance and insolence!  and what inclines one less to bear  she has no fair pretence of family or blood   she was nobody when he married her  barely the daughter of a gentleman  but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims   but in herself  i assure you  she is an upstart     only think! well  that must be infinitely provoking!  i have quite a horror of upstarts   maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort  for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves!  your description of mrs  churchill made me think of them directly   people of the name of tupman  very lately settled there  and encumbered with many low connexions  but giving themselves immense airs  and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families   a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall  and how they got their fortune nobody knows  they came from birmingham  which is not a place to promise much  you know  mr  weston   one has not great hopes from birmingham  i always say there is something direful in the sound   but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans  though a good many things i assure you are suspected  and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother  mr  suckling  who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours   it is infinitely too bad  mr  suckling  who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove  and whose father had it before him  i believe  at least  i am almost sure that old mr  suckling had completed the purchase before his death    they were interrupted   tea was carrying round  and mr  weston  having said all that he wanted  soon took the opportunity of walking away   after tea  mr  and mrs  weston  and mr  elton sat down with mr  woodhouse to cards   the remaining five were left to their own powers  and emma doubted their getting on very well  for mr  knightley seemed little disposed for conversation  mrs  elton was wanting notice  which nobody had inclination to pay  and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent   mr  john knightley proved more talkative than his brother  he was to leave them early the next day  and he soon began with     well  emma  i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys  but you have your sister  letter  and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure   my charge would be much more concise than her   and probably not much in the same spirit  all that i have to recommend being comprised in  do not spoil them  and do not physic them     i rather hope to satisfy you both   said emma   for i shall do all in my power to make them happy  which will be enough for isabella  and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic     and if you find them troublesome  you must send them home again     that is very likely   you think so  do not you     i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father   or even may be some encumbrance to you  if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately     increase!    certainly  you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life     difference!  no indeed i am not     there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be   witness this very time   here am i come down for only one day  and you are engaged with a dinner party!   when did it happen before  or any thing like it   your neighbourhood is increasing  and you mix more with it   a little while ago  every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties  dinners at mr  cole   or balls at the crown   the difference which randalls  randalls alone makes in your goings on  is very great     yes   said his brother quickly   it is randalls that does it all     very well  and as randalls  i suppose  is not likely to have less influence than heretofore  it strikes me as a possible thing  emma  that henry and john may be sometimes in the way   and if they are  i only beg you to send them home     no   cried mr  knightley   that need not be the consequence  let them be sent to donwell   i shall certainly be at leisure     upon my word   exclaimed emma   you amuse me!  i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party  and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys   these amazing engagements of mine   what have they been   dining once with the coles  and having a ball talked of  which never took place   i can understand you   nodding at mr  john knightley   your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here  delights you too much to pass unnoticed  but you   turning to mr  knightley   who know how very  very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield  why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me  i cannot imagine   and as to my dear little boys  i must say  that if aunt emma has not time for them  i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley  who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one   and who  when he is at home  is either reading to himself or settling his accounts    mr  knightley seemed to be trying not to smile  and succeeded without difficulty  upon mrs  elton  beginning to talk to him      volume iii    chapter i   a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill  she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed  it was for him   her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing  it was not worth thinking of    but if he  who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two  were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away  it would be very distressing   if a separation of two months should not have cooled him  there were dangers and evils before her   caution for him and for herself would be necessary  she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again  and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his   she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration  that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet  she could not help rather anticipating something decisive  she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis  an event  a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state   it was not very long  though rather longer than mr  weston had foreseen  before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill  feelings   the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined  but he was at highbury very soon afterwards   he rode down for a couple of hours  he could not yet do more  but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield  she could then exercise all her quick observation  and speedily determine how he was influenced  and how she must act   they met with the utmost friendliness  there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her  but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done  of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree  she watched him well   it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been   absence  with the conviction probably of her indifference  had produced this very natural and very desirable effect   he was in high spirits  as ready to talk and laugh as ever  and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit  and recur to old stories  and he was not without agitation   it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference   he was not calm  his spirits were evidently fluttered  there was restlessness about him  lively as he was  it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself  but what decided her belief on the subject  was his staying only a quarter of an hour  and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury   he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed   he had not stopped  he would not stop for more than a word  but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call  and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield  he must hurry off   she had no doubt as to his being less in love  but neither his agitated spirits  nor his hurrying away  seemed like a perfect cure  and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power  and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long   this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days  he was often hoping  intending to come  but was always prevented  his aunt could not bear to have him leave her   such was his own account at randall   if he were quite sincere  if he really tried to come  it was to be inferred that mrs  churchill  removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder  that she was really ill was very certain  he had declared himself convinced of it  at randalls   though much might be fancy  he could not doubt  when he looked back  that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago   he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove  or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her  but he could not be prevailed on  by all his father  doubts  to say that her complaints were merely imaginary  or that she was as strong as ever   it soon appeared that london was not the place for her   she could not endure its noise   her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering  and by the ten days' end  her nephew  letter to randalls communicated a change of plan   they were going to remove immediately to richmond   mrs  churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there  and had otherwise a fancy for the place   a ready furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged  and much benefit expected from the change   emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement  and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends   for the house was taken for may and june   she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them  almost as often as he could even wish   emma saw how mr  weston understood these joyous prospects   he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered  she hoped it was not so   two months must bring it to the proof   mr  weston  own happiness was indisputable   he was quite delighted  it was the very circumstance he could have wished for   now  it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood   what were nine miles to a young man   an hour  ride   he would be always coming over  the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never   sixteen miles  nay  eighteen  it must be full eighteen to manchester street  was a serious obstacle   were he ever able to get away  the day would be spent in coming and returning  there was no comfort in having him in london  he might as well be at enscombe  but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse  better than nearer!  one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal    the ball at the crown   it had not been forgotten before  but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day   now  however  it was absolutely to be  every preparation was resumed  and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond  a few lines from frank  to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change  and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four hours at any given time  induced them to name as early a day as possible   mr  weston  ball was to be a real thing   a very few to morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness   mr  woodhouse was resigned   the time of year lightened the evil to him   may was better for every thing than february   mrs  bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield  james had due notice  and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them  while dear emma were gone     chapter ii   no misfortune occurred  again to prevent the ball   the day approached  the day arrived  and after a morning of some anxious watching  frank churchill  in all the certainty of his own self  reached randalls before dinner  and every thing was safe   no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma  the room at the crown was to witness it   but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd   mr  weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves  for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came  that she could not refuse him  and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man  company   she was to convey harriet  and they drove to the crown in good time  the randalls party just sufficiently before them   frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch  and though he did not say much  his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening   they all walked about together  to see that every thing was as it should be  and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage  which emma could not hear the sound of at first  without great surprize   so unreasonably early!  she was going to exclaim  but she presently found that it was a family of old friends  who were coming  like herself  by particular desire  to help mr  weston  judgment  and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins  who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness  on the same errand  that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection   emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr  weston depended  and felt  that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes  was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity  she liked his open manners  but a little less of open heartedness would have made him a higher character   general benevolence  but not general friendship  made a man what he ought to be    she could fancy such a man   the whole party walked about  and looked  and praised again  and then  having nothing else to do  formed a sort of half circle round the fire  to observe in their various modes  till other subjects were started  that  though  may   a fire in the evening was still very pleasant   emma found that it was not mr  weston  fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger   they had stopped at mrs  bates  door to offer the use of their carriage  but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons   frank was standing by her  but not steadily  there was a restlessness  which shewed a mind not at ease   he was looking about  he was going to the door  he was watching for the sound of other carriages    impatient to begin  or afraid of being always near her   mrs  elton was spoken of    i think she must be here soon   said he   i have a great curiosity to see mrs  elton  i have heard so much of her   it cannot be long  i think  before she comes    a carriage was heard   he was on the move immediately  but coming back  said    i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her   i have never seen either mr  or mrs  elton   i have no business to put myself forward    mr  and mrs  elton appeared  and all the smiles and the proprieties passed    but miss bates and miss fairfax!  said mr  weston  looking about   we thought you were to bring them    the mistake had been slight   the carriage was sent for them now  emma longed to know what frank  first opinion of mrs  elton might be  how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress  and her smiles of graciousness   he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion  by giving her very proper attention  after the introduction had passed   in a few minutes the carriage returned   somebody talked of rain     i will see that there are umbrellas  sir   said frank to his father   miss bates must not be forgotten    and away he went   mr  weston was following  but mrs  elton detained him  to gratify him by her opinion of his son  and so briskly did she begin  that the young man himself  though by no means moving slowly  could hardly be out of hearing    a very fine young man indeed  mr  weston   you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion  and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him   you may believe me   i never compliment  i think him a very handsome young man  and his manners are precisely what i like and approve  so truly the gentleman  without the least conceit or puppyism   you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies   quite a horror of them   they were never tolerated at maple grove  neither mr  suckling nor me had ever any patience with them  and we used sometimes to say very cutting things!  selina  who is mild almost to a fault  bore with them much better    while she talked of his son  mr  weston  attention was chained  but when she got to maple grove  he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to  and with happy smiles must hurry away   mrs  elton turned to mrs  weston    i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane   our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!  i believe we drive faster than any body    what a pleasure it is to send one  carriage for a friend!   i understand you were so kind as to offer  but another time it will be quite unnecessary   you may be very sure i shall always take care of  them     miss bates and miss fairfax  escorted by the two gentlemen  walked into the room  and mrs  elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs  weston  to receive them   her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma  but her words  every body  words  were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates  who came in talking  and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire   as the door opened she was heard    so very obliging of you!  no rain at all   nothing to signify  i do not care for myself   quite thick shoes   and jane declares   well!   as soon as she was within the door  well!  this is brilliant indeed!  this is admirable!  excellently contrived  upon my word  nothing wanting   could not have imagined it   so well lighted up!   jane  jane  look!  did you ever see any thing   oh!  mr  weston  you must really have had aladdin  lamp   good mrs  stokes would not know her own room again   i saw her as i came in  she was standing in the entrance   `oh!  mrs  stokes ' said i   but i had not time for more    she was now met by mrs  weston     very well  i thank you  ma'am  i hope you are quite well  very happy to hear it   so afraid you might have a headache!   seeing you pass by so often  and knowing how much trouble you must have  delighted to hear it indeed   ah! dear mrs  elton  so obliged to you for the carriage!  excellent time   jane and i quite ready  did not keep the horses a moment   most comfortable carriage    oh! and i am sure our thanks are due to you  mrs  weston  on that score  mrs  elton had most kindly sent jane a note  or we should have been    but two such offers in one day!  never were such neighbours  i said to my mother  `upon my word  ma'am   '  thank you  my mother is remarkably well   gone to mr  woodhouse   i made her take her shawl  for the evenings are not warm  her large new shawl   mrs  dixon  wedding present   so kind of her to think of my mother! bought at weymouth  you know  mr  dixon  choice   there were three others  jane says  which they hesitated about some time  colonel campbell rather preferred an olive   my dear jane  are you sure you did not wet your feet   it was but a drop or two  but i am so afraid   but mr  frank churchill was so extremely   and there was a mat to step upon  i shall never forget his extreme politeness   oh!  mr  frank churchill  i must tell you my mother  spectacles have never been in fault since  the rivet never came out again   my mother often talks of your good nature  does not she  jane   do not we often talk of mr  frank churchill    ah! here  miss woodhouse   dear miss woodhouse  how do you do    very well i thank you  quite well   this is meeting quite in fairy land!   such a transformation!  must not compliment  i know  eyeing emma most complacently   that would be rude  but upon my word  miss woodhouse  you do look  how do you like jane  hair   you are a judge    she did it all herself   quite wonderful how she does her hair!   no hairdresser from london i think could   ah! dr  hughes i declare   and mrs  hughes   must go and speak to dr  and mrs  hughes for a moment   how do you do   how do you do   very well  i thank you  this is delightful  is not it   where  dear mr  richard    oh! there he is   don't disturb him   much better employed talking to the young ladies   how do you do  mr  richard   i saw you the other day as you rode through the town  mrs  otway  i protest!   and good mr  otway  and miss otway and miss caroline   such a host of friends!  and mr  george and mr  arthur!  how do you do   how do you all do   quite well  i am much obliged to you   never better    don't i hear another carriage   who can this be   very likely the worthy coles   upon my word  this is charming to be standing about among such friends!  and such a noble fire!  i am quite roasted  no coffee  i thank you  for me  never take coffee   a little tea if you please  sir  by and bye   no hurry  oh! here it comes  every thing so good!   frank churchill returned to his station by emma  and as soon as miss bates was quiet  she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs  elton and miss fairfax  who were standing a little way behind her   he was thoughtful   whether he were overhearing too  she could not determine   after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look  compliments very quietly and properly taken  mrs  elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself   and it was   how do you like my gown   how do you like my trimming    how has wright done my hair    with many other relative questions  all answered with patient politeness   mrs  elton then said   nobody can think less of dress in general than i do  but upon such an occasion as this  when every body  eyes are so much upon me  and in compliment to the westons  who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour  i would not wish to be inferior to others   and i see very few pearls in the room except mine    so frank churchill is a capital dancer  i understand   we shall see if our styles suit   a fine young man certainly is frank churchill  i like him very well    at this moment frank began talking so vigorously  that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises  and did not want to hear more   and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while  till another suspension brought mrs  elton  tones again distinctly forward   mr  elton had just joined them  and his wife was exclaiming    oh! you have found us out at last  have you  in our seclusion    i was this moment telling jane  i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us     jane!   repeated frank churchill  with a look of surprize and displeasure     that is easy  but miss fairfax does not disapprove it  i suppose     how do you like mrs  elton   said emma in a whisper    not at all     you are ungrateful     ungrateful!  what do you mean    then changing from a frown to a smile   no  do not tell me  i do not want to know what you mean    where is my father   when are we to begin dancing    emma could hardly understand him  he seemed in an odd humour  he walked off to find his father  but was quickly back again with both mr  and mrs  weston   he had met with them in a little perplexity  which must be laid before emma   it had just occurred to mrs  weston that mrs  elton must be asked to begin the ball  that she would expect it  which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction   emma heard the sad truth with fortitude    and what are we to do for a proper partner for her   said mr  weston   she will think frank ought to ask her    frank turned instantly to emma  to claim her former promise  and boasted himself an engaged man  which his father looked his most perfect approbation of  and it then appeared that mrs  weston was wanting  him  to dance with mrs  elton himself  and that their business was to help to persuade him into it  which was done pretty soon    mr  weston and mrs  elton led the way  mr  frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed   emma must submit to stand second to mrs  elton  though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her  it was almost enough to make her think of marrying   mrs  elton had undoubtedly the advantage  at this time  in vanity completely gratified  for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill  she could not lose by the change   mr  weston might be his son  superior    in spite of this little rub  however  emma was smiling with enjoyment  delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming  and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her    she was more disturbed by mr  knightley  not dancing than by any thing else   there he was  among the standers by  where he ought not to be  he ought to be dancing   not classing himself with the husbands  and fathers  and whist players  who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up   so young as he looked!   he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere  than where he had placed himself   his tall  firm  upright figure  among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men  was such as emma felt must draw every body  eyes  and  excepting her own partner  there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him   he moved a few steps nearer  and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner  with what natural grace  he must have danced  would he but take the trouble   whenever she caught his eye  she forced him to smile  but in general he was looking grave   she wished he could love a ballroom better  and could like frank churchill better    he seemed often observing her   she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing  but if he were criticising her behaviour  she did not feel afraid   there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner   they seemed more like cheerful  easy friends  than lovers   that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done  was indubitable   the ball proceeded pleasantly   the anxious cares  the incessant attentions of mrs  weston  were not thrown away   every body seemed happy  and the praise of being a delightful ball  which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be  was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this  of very important  very recordable events  it was not more productive than such meetings usually are   there was one  however  which emma thought something of   the two last dances before supper were begun  and harriet had no partner   the only young lady sitting down    and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers  that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!  but emma  wonder lessened soon afterwards  on seeing mr  elton sauntering about  he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided  she was sure he would not  and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card room   escape  however  was not his plan   he came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected  spoke to some  and walked about in front of them  as if to shew his liberty  and his resolution of maintaining it   he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith  or speaking to those who were close to her    emma saw it   she was not yet dancing  she was working her way up from the bottom  and had therefore leisure to look around  and by only turning her head a little she saw it all   when she was half way up the set  the whole group were exactly behind her  and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch  but mr  elton was so near  that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs  weston  and she perceived that his wife  who was standing immediately above her  was not only listening also  but even encouraging him by significant glances   the kind hearted  gentle mrs  weston had left her seat to join him and say   do not you dance  mr  elton   to which his prompt reply was   most readily  mrs  weston  if you will dance with me     me!  oh! no  i would get you a better partner than myself  i am no dancer     if mrs  gilbert wishes to dance   said he   i shall have great pleasure  i am sure  for  though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man  and that my dancing days are over  it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs  gilbert     mrs  gilbert does not mean to dance  but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing  miss smith    miss smith!  oh!  i had not observed   you are extremely obliging   and if i were not an old married man   but my dancing days are over  mrs  weston   you will excuse me   any thing else i should be most happy to do  at your command  but my dancing days are over    mrs  weston said no more  and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat  this was mr  elton! the amiable  obliging  gentle mr  elton    she looked round for a moment  he had joined mr  knightley at a little distance  and was arranging himself for settled conversation  while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife   she would not look again   her heart was in a glow  and she feared her face might be as hot   in another moment a happier sight caught her   mr  knightley leading harriet to the set!  never had she been more surprized  seldom more delighted  than at that instant   she was all pleasure and gratitude  both for harriet and herself  and longed to be thanking him  and though too distant for speech  her countenance said much  as soon as she could catch his eye again   his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it  extremely good  and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky  if it had not been for the cruel state of things before  and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced   it was not thrown away on her  she bounded higher than ever  flew farther down the middle  and was in a continual course of smiles   mr  elton had retreated into the card room  looking  emma trusted  very foolish   she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife  though growing very like her    she  spoke some of her feelings  by observing audibly to her partner    knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith!  very goodnatured  i declare    supper was announced   the move began  and miss bates might be heard from that moment  without interruption  till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon    jane  jane  my dear jane  where are you   here is your tippet  mrs  weston begs you to put on your tippet   she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage  though every thing has been done  one door nailed up  quantities of matting  my dear jane  indeed you must   mr  churchill  oh! you are too obliging! how well you put it on!  so gratified!  excellent dancing indeed!   yes  my dear  i ran home  as i said i should  to help grandmama to bed  and got back again  and nobody missed me   i set off without saying a word  just as i told you   grandmama was quite well  had a charming evening with mr  woodhouse  a vast deal of chat  and backgammon   tea was made downstairs  biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away   amazing luck in some of her throws  and she inquired a great deal about you  how you were amused  and who were your partners   `oh!' said i  `i shall not forestall jane  i left her dancing with mr  george otway  she will love to tell you all about it herself to morrow  her first partner was mr  elton  i do not know who will ask her next  perhaps mr  william cox ' my dear sir  you are too obliging   is there nobody you would not rather   i am not helpless   sir  you are most kind   upon my word  jane on one arm  and me on the other!  stop  stop  let us stand a little back  mrs  elton is going  dear mrs  elton  how elegant she looks!  beautiful lace!  now we all follow in her train  quite the queen of the evening!  well  here we are at the passage  two steps  jane  take care of the two steps   oh! no  there is but one   well  i was persuaded there were two   how very odd! i was convinced there were two  and there is but one   i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style  candles everywhere   i was telling you of your grandmama  jane   there was a little disappointment    the baked apples and biscuits  excellent in their way  you know  but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first  and good mr  woodhouse  not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough  sent it all out again   now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus   so she was rather disappointed  but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body  for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse  who would be so very much concerned!  well  this is brilliant! i am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!  such elegance and profusion!  i have seen nothing like it since   well  where shall we sit  where shall we sit   anywhere  so that jane is not in a draught   where  i  sit is of no consequence  oh! do you recommend this side   well  i am sure  mr  churchill   only it seems too good  but just as you please   what you direct in this house cannot be wrong   dear jane  how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama   soup too!  bless me! i should not be helped so soon  but it smells most excellent  and i cannot help beginning    emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr  knightley till after supper  but  when they were all in the ballroom again  her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked  he was warm in his reprobation of mr  elton  conduct  it had been unpardonable rudeness  and mrs  elton  looks also received the due share of censure    they aimed at wounding more than harriet   said he    emma  why is it that they are your enemies    he looked with smiling penetration  and  on receiving no answer  added    she  ought not to be angry with you  i suspect  whatever he may be   to that surmise  you say nothing  of course  but confess  emma  that you did want him to marry harriet     i did   replied emma   and they cannot forgive me    he shook his head  but there was a smile of indulgence with it  and he only said    i shall not scold you   i leave you to your own reflections     can you trust me with such flatterers   does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong     not your vain spirit  but your serious spirit   if one leads you wrong  i am sure the other tells you of it     i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr  elton  there is a littleness about him which you discovered  and which i did not   and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet  it was through a series of strange blunders!    and  in return for your acknowledging so much  i will do you the justice to say  that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself   harriet smith has some first rate qualities  which mrs  elton is totally without   an unpretending  single minded  artless girl   infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs  elton   i found harriet more conversable than i expected    emma was extremely gratified   they were interrupted by the bustle of mr  weston calling on every body to begin dancing again    come miss woodhouse  miss otway  miss fairfax  what are you all doing    come emma  set your companions the example   every body is lazy! every body is asleep!    i am ready   said emma   whenever i am wanted     whom are you going to dance with   asked mr  knightley   she hesitated a moment  and then replied   with you  if you will ask me     will you   said he  offering his hand    indeed i will   you have shewn that you can dance  and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper     brother and sister! no  indeed      chapter iii   this little explanation with mr  knightley gave emma considerable pleasure   it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball  which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy   she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons  and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike  and his praise of harriet  his concession in her favour  was peculiarly gratifying   the impertinence of the eltons  which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening  had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions  and she looked forward to another happy result  the cure of harriet  infatuation    from harriet  manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom  she had strong hopes   it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened  and she were enabled to see that mr  elton was not the superior creature she had believed him   the fever was over  and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy   she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite   harriet rational  frank churchill not too much in love  and mr  knightley not wanting to quarrel with her  how very happy a summer must be before her!  she was not to see frank churchill this morning   he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield  as he was to be at home by the middle of the day  she did not regret it   having arranged all these matters  looked them through  and put them all to rights  she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys  as well as of their grandpapa  when the great iron sweep gate opened  and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together  frank churchill  with harriet leaning on his arm  actually harriet!  a moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened  harriet looked white and frightened  and he was trying to cheer her    the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder    they were all three soon in the hall  and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away   a young lady who faints  must be recovered  questions must be answered  and surprizes be explained   such events are very interesting  but the suspense of them cannot last long   a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole   miss smith  and miss bickerton  another parlour boarder at mrs  goddard   who had been also at the ball  had walked out together  and taken a road  the richmond road  which  though apparently public enough for safety  had led them into alarm   about half a mile beyond highbury  making a sudden turn  and deeply shaded by elms on each side  it became for a considerable stretch very retired  and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it  they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them  on a broader patch of greensward by the side  a party of gipsies  a child on the watch  came towards them to beg  and miss bickerton  excessively frightened  gave a great scream  and calling on harriet to follow her  ran up a steep bank  cleared a slight hedge at the top  and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury  but poor harriet could not follow   she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing  and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless   and in this state  and exceedingly terrified  she had been obliged to remain   how the trampers might have behaved  had the young ladies been more courageous  must be doubtful  but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted  and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children  headed by a stout woman and a great boy  all clamorous  and impertinent in look  though not absolutely in word   more and more frightened  she immediately promised them money  and taking out her purse  gave them a shilling  and begged them not to want more  or to use her ill   she was then able to walk  though but slowly  and was moving away  but her terror and her purse were too tempting  and she was followed  or rather surrounded  by the whole gang  demanding more   in this state frank churchill had found her  she trembling and conditioning  they loud and insolent   by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment   the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward  and leave his horses to meet him by another road  a mile or two beyond highbury   and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates  and to have forgotten to restore them  he had been obliged to stop at her door  and go in for a few minutes  he was therefore later than he had intended  and being on foot  was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them  the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion   he had left them completely frightened  and harriet eagerly clinging to him  and hardly able to speak  had just strength enough to reach hartfield  before her spirits were quite overcome   it was his idea to bring her to hartfield  he had thought of no other place   this was the amount of the whole story   of his communication and of harriet  as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech    he dared not stay longer than to see her well  these several delays left him not another minute to lose  and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs  goddard  and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr  knightley  he set off  with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself   such an adventure as this   a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way  could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain  so emma thought  at least   could a linguist  could a grammarian  could even a mathematician have seen what she did  have witnessed their appearance together  and heard their history of it  without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other   how much more must an imaginist  like herself  be on fire with speculation and foresight!  especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made   it was a very extraordinary thing!  nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place  within her memory  no rencontre  no alarm of the kind   and now it had happened to the very person  and at the very hour  when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!  it certainly was very extraordinary!  and knowing  as she did  the favourable state of mind of each at this period  it struck her the more  he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself  she just recovering from her mania for mr  elton   it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences  it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other   in the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him  while harriet had been partially insensible  he had spoken of her terror  her naivete  her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm  with a sensibility amused and delighted  and just at last  after harriet  own account had been given  he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms  every thing was to take its natural course  however  neither impelled nor assisted   she would not stir a step  nor drop a hint  no  she had had enough of interference   there could be no harm in a scheme  a mere passive scheme   it was no more than a wish  beyond it she would on no account proceed   emma  first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed   aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion  but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible   within half an hour it was known all over highbury   it was the very event to engage those who talk most  the young and the low  and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news   the last night  ball seemed lost in the gipsies  poor mr  woodhouse trembled as he sat  and  as emma had foreseen  would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again   it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse  for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after   as well as miss smith  were coming in during the rest of the day  and he had the pleasure of returning for answer  that they were all very indifferent   which  though not exactly true  for she was perfectly well  and harriet not much otherwise  emma would not interfere with  she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man  for she hardly knew what indisposition was  and if he did not invent illnesses for her  she could make no figure in a message   the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice  they took themselves off in a hurry   the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began  and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews   in her imagination it maintained its ground  and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies  and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital     chapter iv   a very few days had passed after this adventure  when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand  and after sitting down and hesitating  thus began    miss woodhouse  if you are at leisure  i have something that i should like to tell you  a sort of confession to make  and then  you know  it will be over    emma was a good deal surprized  but begged her to speak  there was a seriousness in harriet  manner which prepared her  quite as much as her words  for something more than ordinary    it is my duty  and i am sure it is my wish   she continued   to have no reserves with you on this subject   as i am happily quite an altered creature in  one   respect   it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it   i do not want to say more than is necessary  i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done  and i dare say you understand me     yes   said emma   i hope i do     how i could so long a time be fancying myself!        cried harriet  warmly    it seems like madness!  i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now   i do not care whether i meet him or not  except that of the two i had rather not see him   and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him  but i do not envy his wife in the least  i neither admire her nor envy her  as i have done   she is very charming  i dare say  and all that  but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable  i shall never forget her look the other night!  however  i assure you  miss woodhouse  i wish her no evil   no  let them be ever so happy together  it will not give me another moment  pang   and to convince you that i have been speaking truth  i am now going to destroy  what i ought to have destroyed long ago  what i ought never to have kept   i know that very well  blushing as she spoke    however  now i will destroy it all  and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence  that you may see how rational i am grown  cannot you guess what this parcel holds   said she  with a conscious look    not the least in the world   did he ever give you any thing     no  i cannot call them gifts  but they are things that i have valued very much    she held the parcel towards her  and emma read the words  most   precious   treasures  on the top   her curiosity was greatly excited  harriet unfolded the parcel  and she looked on with impatience  within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box  which harriet opened   it was well lined with the softest cotton  but  excepting the cotton  emma saw only a small piece of court plaister    now   said harriet   you  must  recollect     no  indeed i do not     dear me!  i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister  one of the very last times we ever met in it!  it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat  just before mr  and mrs  john knightley came   i think the very evening   do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife  and your recommending court plaister    but  as you had none about you  and knew i had  you desired me to supply him  and so i took mine out and cut him a piece  but it was a great deal too large  and he cut it smaller  and kept playing some time with what was left  before he gave it back to me  and so then  in my nonsense  i could not help making a treasure of it   so i put it by never to be used  and looked at it now and then as a great treat     my dearest harriet!  cried emma  putting her hand before her face  and jumping up   you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear  remember it   aye  i remember it all now  all  except your saving this relic  i knew nothing of that till this moment  but the cutting the finger  and my recommending court plaister  and saying i had none about me!  oh! my sins  my sins!  and i had plenty all the while in my pocket!  one of my senseless tricks!  i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life   well   sitting down again    go on  what else     and had you really some at hand yourself   i am sure i never suspected it  you did it so naturally     and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake!  said emma  recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement   and secretly she added to herself   lord bless me! when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about! i never was equal to this     here   resumed harriet  turning to her box again   here is something still more valuable  i mean that  has   been  more valuable  because this is what did really once belong to him  which the court plaister never did    emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure   it was the end of an old pencil   the part without any lead    this was really his   said harriet    do not you remember one morning   no  i dare say you do not   but one morning  i forget exactly the day  but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before  that   evening   he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book  it was about spruce beer  mr  knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer  and he wanted to put it down  but when he took out his pencil  there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away  and it would not do  so you lent him another  and this was left upon the table as good for nothing   but i kept my eye on it  and  as soon as i dared  caught it up  and never parted with it again from that moment     i do remember it   cried emma   i perfectly remember it    talking about spruce beer   oh! yes  mr  knightley and i both saying we liked it  and mr  elton  seeming resolved to learn to like it too  i perfectly remember it   stop  mr  knightley was standing just here  was not he   i have an idea he was standing just here     ah!  i do not know   i cannot recollect   it is very odd  but i cannot recollect   mr  elton was sitting here  i remember  much about where i am now       well  go on     oh! that  all   i have nothing more to shew you  or to say   except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire  and i wish you to see me do it     my poor dear harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things     yes  simpleton as i was!  but i am quite ashamed of it now  and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them   it was very wrong of me  you know  to keep any remembrances  after he was married  i knew it was  but had not resolution enough to part with them     but  harriet  is it necessary to burn the court plaister   i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil  but the court plaister might be useful     i shall be happier to burn it   replied harriet    it has a disagreeable look to me   i must get rid of every thing    there it goes  and there is an end  thank heaven! of mr  elton     and when   thought emma   will there be a beginning of mr  churchill    she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made  and could not but hope that the gipsy  though she had  told  no fortune  might be proved to have made harriet    about a fortnight after the alarm  they came to a sufficient explanation  and quite undesignedly   emma was not thinking of it at the moment  which made the information she received more valuable  she merely said  in the course of some trivial chat   well  harriet  whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so   and thought no more of it  till after a minute  silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone   i shall never marry    emma then looked up  and immediately saw how it was  and after a moment  debate  as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not  replied    never marry!  this is a new resolution     it is one that i shall never change  however    after another short hesitation   i hope it does not proceed from   i hope it is not in compliment to mr  elton     mr  elton indeed!  cried harriet indignantly    oh! no   and emma could just catch the words   so superior to mr  elton!   she then took a longer time for consideration   should she proceed no farther   should she let it pass  and seem to suspect nothing    perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did  or perhaps if she were totally silent  it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much  and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been  such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances  she was perfectly resolved    she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once  all that she meant to say and know   plain dealing was always best  she had previously determined how far she would proceed  on any application of the sort  and it would be safer for both  to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed    she was decided  and thus spoke     harriet  i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning  your resolution  or rather your expectation of never marrying  results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer  would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you  is not it so     oh!  miss woodhouse  believe me i have not the presumption to suppose   indeed i am not so mad   but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance  and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world  with the gratitude  wonder  and veneration  which are so proper  in me especially     i am not at all surprized at you  harriet   the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart     service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!   the very recollection of it  and all that i felt at the time   when i saw him coming  his noble look  and my wretchedness before  such a change!  in one moment such a change!  from perfect misery to perfect happiness!    it is very natural   it is natural  and it is honourable    yes  honourable  i think  to chuse so well and so gratefully    but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise  i do not advise you to give way to it  harriet   i do not by any means engage for its being returned   consider what you are about  perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can  at any rate do not let them carry you far  unless you are persuaded of his liking you   be observant of him   let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations   i give you this caution now  because i shall never speak to you again on the subject   i am determined against all interference   henceforward i know nothing of the matter  let no name ever pass our lips   we were very wrong before  we will be cautious now   he is your superior  no doubt  and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature  but yet  harriet  more wonderful things have taken place  there have been matches of greater disparity   but take care of yourself  i would not have you too sanguine  though  however it may end  be assured your raising your thoughts to  him   is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value    harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude  emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend   its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind   and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation     chapter v   in this state of schemes  and hopes  and connivance  june opened upon hartfield   to highbury in general it brought no material change  the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings  and of the use to be made of their barouche landau  and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother   and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed  and august  instead of midsummer  fixed for it  she was likely to remain there full two months longer  provided at least she were able to defeat mrs  elton  activity in her service  and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will   mr  knightley  who  for some reason best known to himself  had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill  was only growing to dislike him more   he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma   that emma was his object appeared indisputable  every thing declared it  his own attentions  his father  hints  his mother in law  guarded silence  it was all in unison  words  conduct  discretion  and indiscretion  told the same story  but while so many were devoting him to emma  and emma herself making him over to harriet  mr  knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax   he could not understand it  but there were symptoms of intelligence between them  he thought so at least   symptoms of admiration on his side  which  having once observed  he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning  however he might wish to escape any of emma  errors of imagination   she  was not present when the suspicion first arose   he was dining with the randalls family  and jane  at the eltons'  and he had seen a look  more than a single look  at miss fairfax  which  from the admirer of miss woodhouse  seemed somewhat out of place  when he was again in their company  he could not help remembering what he had seen  nor could he avoid observations which  unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight    myself creating what i saw    brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking  of private understanding even  between frank churchill and jane   he had walked up one day after dinner  as he very often did  to spend his evening at hartfield   emma and harriet were going to walk  he joined them  and  on returning  they fell in with a larger party  who  like themselves  judged it wisest to take their exercise early  as the weather threatened rain  mr  and mrs  weston and their son  miss bates and her niece  who had accidentally met  they all united  and  on reaching hartfield gates  emma  who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father  pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him   the randalls party agreed to it immediately  and after a pretty long speech from miss bates  which few persons listened to  she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse  most obliging invitation   as they were turning into the grounds  mr  perry passed by on horseback  the gentlemen spoke of his horse    by the bye   said frank churchill to mrs  weston presently   what became of mr  perry  plan of setting up his carriage    mrs  weston looked surprized  and said   i did not know that he ever had any such plan     nay  i had it from you   you wrote me word of it three months ago     me! impossible!    indeed you did   i remember it perfectly   you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon   mrs  perry had told somebody  and was extremely happy about it   it was owing to  her  persuasion  as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm   you must remember it now     upon my word i never heard of it till this moment     never! really  never!  bless me! how could it be   then i must have dreamt it  but i was completely persuaded  miss smith  you walk as if you were tired   you will not be sorry to find yourself at home     what is this   what is this   cried mr  weston   about perry and a carriage   is perry going to set up his carriage  frank  i am glad he can afford it   you had it from himself  had you     no  sir   replied his son  laughing   i seem to have had it from nobody   very odd!  i really was persuaded of mrs  weston  having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe  many weeks ago  with all these particulars  but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before  of course it must have been a dream   i am a great dreamer   i dream of every body at highbury when i am away   and when i have gone through my particular friends  then i begin dreaming of mr  and mrs  perry     it is odd though   observed his father   that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe   perry  setting up his carriage! and his wife  persuading him to it  out of care for his health   just what will happen  i have no doubt  some time or other  only a little premature   what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!  and at others  what a heap of absurdities it is!  well  frank  your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent   emma  you are a great dreamer  i think    emma was out of hearing   she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance  and was beyond the reach of mr  weston  hint    why  to own the truth   cried miss bates  who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes   if i must speak on this subject  there is no denying that mr  frank churchill might have  i do not mean to say that he did not dream it  i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world  but if i am questioned about it  i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring  for mrs  perry herself mentioned it to my mother  and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves  but it was quite a secret  known to nobody else  and only thought of about three days  mrs  perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage  and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed   jane  don't you remember grandmama  telling us of it when we got home   i forget where we had been walking to   very likely to randalls  yes  i think it was to randalls  mrs  perry was always particularly fond of my mother  indeed i do not know who is not  and she had mentioned it to her in confidence  she had no objection to her telling us  of course  but it was not to go beyond   and  from that day to this  i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of   at the same time  i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint  because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware   i am a talker  you know  i am rather a talker  and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not   i am not like jane  i wish i were  i will answer for it  she  never betrayed the least thing in the world  where is she   oh! just behind   perfectly remember mrs  perry  coming    extraordinary dream  indeed!   they were entering the hall   mr  knightley  eyes had preceded miss bates  in a glance at jane   from frank churchill  face  where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away  he had involuntarily turned to hers  but she was indeed behind  and too busy with her shawl   mr  weston had walked in   the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass   mr  knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye   he seemed watching her intently  in vain  however  if it were so   jane passed between them into the hall  and looked at neither   there was no time for farther remark or explanation   the dream must be borne with  and mr  knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield  and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use  instead of the small sized pembroke  on which two of his daily meals had  for forty years been crowded  tea passed pleasantly  and nobody seemed in a hurry to move    miss woodhouse   said frank churchill  after examining a table behind him  which he could reach as he sat   have your nephews taken away their alphabets  their box of letters   it used to stand here  where is it   this is a sort of dull looking evening  that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer   we had great amusement with those letters one morning   i want to puzzle you again    emma was pleased with the thought  and producing the box  the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets  which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves   they were rapidly forming words for each other  or for any body else who would be puzzled  the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr  woodhouse  who had often been distressed by the more animated sort  which mr  weston had occasionally introduced  and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting  with tender melancholy  over the departure of the  poor little boys   or in fondly pointing out  as he took up any stray letter near him  how beautifully emma had written it   frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax   she gave a slight glance round the table  and applied herself to it  frank was next to emma  jane opposite to them  and mr  knightley so placed as to see them all  and it was his object to see as much as he could  with as little apparent observation   the word was discovered  and with a faint smile pushed away   if meant to be immediately mixed with the others  and buried from sight  she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across  for it was not mixed  and harriet  eager after every fresh word  and finding out none  directly took it up  and fell to work  she was sitting by mr  knightley  and turned to him for help  the word was  blunder   and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it  there was a blush on jane  cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible   mr  knightley connected it with the dream  but how it could all be  was beyond his comprehension  how the delicacy  the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep!  he feared there must be some decided involvement  disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn  these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick  it was a child  play  chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill  part   with great indignation did he continue to observe him  with great alarm and distrust  to observe also his two blinded companions  he saw a short word prepared for emma  and given to her with a look sly and demure   he saw that emma had soon made it out  and found it highly entertaining  though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure  for she said   nonsense! for shame!  he heard frank churchill next say  with a glance towards jane   i will give it to her  shall i    and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth    no  no  you must not  you shall not  indeed    it was done however   this gallant young man  who seemed to love without feeling  and to recommend himself without complaisance  directly handed over the word to miss fairfax  and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it   mr  knightley  excessive curiosity to know what this word might be  made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it  and it was not long before he saw it to be  dixon    jane fairfax  perception seemed to accompany his  her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning  the superior intelligence  of those five letters so arranged   she was evidently displeased  looked up  and seeing herself watched  blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her  and saying only   i did not know that proper names were allowed   pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit  and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered  her face was averted from those who had made the attack  and turned towards her aunt    aye  very true  my dear   cried the latter  though jane had not spoken a word   i was just going to say the same thing   it is time for us to be going indeed   the evening is closing in  and grandmama will be looking for us   my dear sir  you are too obliging  we really must wish you good night    jane  alertness in moving  proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived   she was immediately up  and wanting to quit the table  but so many were also moving  that she could not get away  and mr  knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her  and resolutely swept away by her unexamined  she was afterwards looking for her shawl  frank churchill was looking also  it was growing dusk  and the room was in confusion  and how they parted  mr  knightley could not tell   he remained at hartfield after all the rest  his thoughts full of what he had seen  so full  that when the candles came to assist his observations  he must  yes  he certainly must  as a friend   an anxious friend  give emma some hint  ask her some question  he could not see her in a situation of such danger  without trying to preserve her   it was his duty    pray  emma   said he   may i ask in what lay the great amusement  the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax  i saw the word  and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one  and so very distressing to the other    emma was extremely confused   she could not endure to give him the true explanation  for though her suspicions were by no means removed  she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them    oh!  she cried in evident embarrassment   it all meant nothing  a mere joke among ourselves     the joke   he replied gravely   seemed confined to you and mr  churchill    he had hoped she would speak again  but she did not   she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak   he sat a little while in doubt   a variety of evils crossed his mind   interference   fruitless interference   emma  confusion  and the acknowledged intimacy  seemed to declare her affection engaged   yet he would speak  he owed it to her  to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference  rather than her welfare  to encounter any thing  rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause    my dear emma   said he at last  with earnest kindness   do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of     between mr  frank churchill and miss fairfax   oh! yes  perfectly    why do you make a doubt of it     have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her  or that she admired him     never  never!  she cried with a most open eagerness   never  for the twentieth part of a moment  did such an idea occur to me  and how could it possibly come into your head     i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them   certain expressive looks  which i did not believe meant to be public     oh! you amuse me excessively   i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander  but it will not do   very sorry to check you in your first essay  but indeed it will not do   there is no admiration between them  i do assure you  and the appearances which have caught you  have arisen from some peculiar circumstances  feelings rather of a totally different nature   it is impossible exactly to explain   there is a good deal of nonsense in it  but the part which is capable of being communicated  which is sense  is  that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another  as any two beings in the world can be  that is  i  presume  it to be so on her side  and i can  answer  for its being so on his   i will answer for the gentleman  indifference    she spoke with a confidence which staggered  with a satisfaction which silenced  mr  knightley   she was in gay spirits  and would have prolonged the conversation  wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions  every look described  and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her   but his gaiety did not meet hers   he found he could not be useful  and his feelings were too much irritated for talking   that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever  by the fire which mr  woodhouse  tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year  he soon afterwards took a hasty leave  and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey     chapter vi   after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr  and mrs  suckling  the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn  no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present   in the daily interchange of news  they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings' coming had been united  such as the last accounts of mrs  churchill  whose health seemed every day to supply a different report  and the situation of mrs  weston  whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child  as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it   mrs  elton was very much disappointed   it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade   her introductions and recommendations must all wait  and every projected party be still only talked of  so she thought at first   but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off   why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come   they could go there again with them in the autumn   it was settled that they should go to box hill   that there was to be such a party had been long generally known   it had even given the idea of another  emma had never been to box hill  she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing  and she and mr  weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither   two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them  and it was to be done in a quiet  unpretending  elegant way  infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation  the regular eating and drinking  and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings   this was so very well understood between them  that emma could not but feel some surprise  and a little displeasure  on hearing from mr  weston that he had been proposing to mrs  elton  as her brother and sister had failed her  that the two parties should unite  and go together  and that as mrs  elton had very readily acceded to it  so it was to be  if she had no objection   now  as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs  elton  of which mr  weston must already be perfectly aware  it was not worth bringing forward again   it could not be done without a reproof to him  which would be giving pain to his wife  and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid  an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs  elton  party!  every feeling was offended  and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr  weston  temper    i am glad you approve of what i have done   said he very comfortably   but i thought you would   such schemes as these are nothing without numbers   one cannot have too large a party   a large party secures its own amusement   and she is a good natured woman after all  one could not leave her out    emma denied none of it aloud  and agreed to none of it in private   it was now the middle of june  and the weather fine  and mrs  elton was growing impatient to name the day  and settle with mr  weston as to pigeon pies and cold lamb  when a lame carriage horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty   it might be weeks  it might be only a few days  before the horse were useable  but no preparations could be ventured on  and it was all melancholy stagnation  mrs  elton  resources were inadequate to such an attack    is not this most vexations  knightley   she cried    and such weather for exploring!  these delays and disappointments are quite odious  what are we to do   the year will wear away at this rate  and nothing done   before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston     you had better explore to donwell   replied mr  knightley   that may be done without horses   come  and eat my strawberries  they are ripening fast    if mr  knightley did not begin seriously  he was obliged to proceed so  for his proposal was caught at with delight  and the  oh!  i should like it of all things   was not plainer in words than manner  donwell was famous for its strawberry beds  which seemed a plea for the invitation   but no plea was necessary  cabbage beds would have been enough to tempt the lady  who only wanted to be going somewhere  she promised him again and again to come  much oftener than he doubted  and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy  such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it    you may depend upon me   said she    i certainly will come  name your day  and i will come   you will allow me to bring jane fairfax     i cannot name a day   said he   till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you     oh! leave all that to me   only give me a carte blanche   i am lady patroness  you know   it is my party   i will bring friends with me     i hope you will bring elton   said he    but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations     oh! now you are looking very sly   but consider  you need not be afraid of delegating power to  me    i am no young lady on her preferment  married women  you know  may be safely authorised   it is my party  leave it all to me   i will invite your guests     no    he calmly replied    there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell  and that one is        mrs  weston  i suppose   interrupted mrs  elton  rather mortified    no  mrs  knightley   and till she is in being  i will manage such matters myself     ah! you are an odd creature!  she cried  satisfied to have no one preferred to herself    you are a humourist  and may say what you like   quite a humourist   well  i shall bring jane with me   jane and her aunt   the rest i leave to you   i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family   don't scruple   i know you are attached to them     you certainly will meet them if i can prevail  and i shall call on miss bates in my way home     that  quite unnecessary  i see jane every day   but as you like  it is to be a morning scheme  you know  knightley  quite a simple thing  i shall wear a large bonnet  and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm   here   probably this basket with pink ribbon  nothing can be more simple  you see   and jane will have such another  there is to be no form or parade  a sort of gipsy party   we are to walk about your gardens  and gather the strawberries ourselves  and sit under trees   and whatever else you may like to provide  it is to be all out of doors  a table spread in the shade  you know  every thing as natural and simple as possible   is not that your idea     not quite   my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room  the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies  with their servants and furniture  i think is best observed by meals within doors   when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden  there shall be cold meat in the house     well  as you please  only don't have a great set out   and  by the bye  can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion    pray be sincere  knightley   if you wish me to talk to mrs  hodges  or to inspect anything      i have not the least wish for it  i thank you     well  but if any difficulties should arise  my housekeeper is extremely clever     i will answer for it  that mine thinks herself full as clever  and would spurn any body  assistance     i wish we had a donkey   the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys  jane  miss bates  and me  and my caro sposo walking by  i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey   in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary  for  let a woman have ever so many resources  it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home   and very long walks  you know  in summer there is dust  and in winter there is dirt     you will not find either  between donwell and highbury  donwell lane is never dusty  and now it is perfectly dry   come on a donkey  however  if you prefer it   you can borrow mrs  cole   i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible     that i am sure you would   indeed i do you justice  my good friend  under that peculiar sort of dry  blunt manner  i know you have the warmest heart   as i tell mr  e   you are a thorough humourist    yes  believe me  knightley  i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme   you have hit upon the very thing to please me    mr  knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade  he wished to persuade mr  woodhouse  as well as emma  to join the party  and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill   mr  woodhouse must not  under the specious pretence of a morning drive  and an hour or two spent at donwell  be tempted away to his misery   he was invited on good faith   no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity   he did consent   he had not been at donwell for two years    some very fine morning  he  and emma  and harriet  could go very well  and he could sit still with mrs  weston  while the dear girls walked about the gardens  he did not suppose they could be damp now  in the middle of the day   he should like to see the old house again exceedingly  and should be very happy to meet mr  and mrs  elton  and any other of his neighbours   he could not see any objection at all to his  and emma   and harriet  going there some very fine morning  he thought it very well done of mr  knightley to invite them   very kind and sensible  much cleverer than dining out   he was not fond of dining out    mr  knightley was fortunate in every body  most ready concurrence  the invitation was everywhere so well received  that it seemed as if  like mrs  elton  they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves   emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it  and mr  weston  unasked  promised to get frank over to join them  if possible  a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with    mr  knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him  and mr  weston engaged to lose no time in writing  and spare no arguments to induce him to come   in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast  that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration  and at last donwell was settled for one day  and box hill for the next   the weather appearing exactly right   under a bright mid day sun  at almost midsummer  mr  woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage  with one window down  to partake of this al fresco party  and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey  especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning  he was happily placed  quite at his ease  ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved  and advise every body to come and sit down  and not to heat themselves    mrs  weston  who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired  and sit all the time with him  remained  when all the others were invited or persuaded out  his patient listener and sympathiser   it was so long since emma had been at the abbey  that as soon as she was satisfied of her father  comfort  she was glad to leave him  and look around her  eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation  more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family   she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant  as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building  its suitable  becoming  characteristic situation  low and sheltered   its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream  of which the abbey  with all the old neglect of prospect  had scarcely a sight  and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues  which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up   the house was larger than hartfield  and totally unlike it  covering a good deal of ground  rambling and irregular  with many comfortable  and one or two handsome rooms   it was just what it ought to be  and it looked what it was  and emma felt an increasing respect for it  as the residence of a family of such true gentility  untainted in blood and understanding   some faults of temper john knightley had  but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably  she had given them neither men  nor names  nor places  that could raise a blush   these were pleasant feelings  and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did  and collect round the strawberry beds   the whole party were assembled  excepting frank churchill  who was expected every moment from richmond  and mrs  elton  in all her apparatus of happiness  her large bonnet and her basket  was very ready to lead the way in gathering  accepting  or talking  strawberries  and only strawberries  could now be thought or spoken of    the best fruit in england   every body  favourite  always wholesome   these the finest beds and finest sorts   delightful to gather for one  self  the only way of really enjoying them   morning decidedly the best time  never tired   every sort good  hautboy infinitely superior  no comparison   the others hardly eatable  hautboys very scarce  chili preferred   white wood finest flavour of all  price of strawberries in london   abundance about bristol  maple grove  cultivation  beds when to be renewed  gardeners thinking exactly different  no general rule   gardeners never to be put out of their way  delicious fruit   only too rich to be eaten much of  inferior to cherries   currants more refreshing  only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping  glaring sun  tired to death  could bear it no longer   must go and sit in the shade    such  for half an hour  was the conversation  interrupted only once by mrs  weston  who came out  in her solicitude after her son in law  to inquire if he were come  and she was a little uneasy    she had some fears of his horse   seats tolerably in the shade were found  and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs  elton and jane fairfax were talking of    a situation  a most desirable situation  was in question   mrs  elton had received notice of it that morning  and was in raptures  it was not with mrs  suckling  it was not with mrs  bragge  but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them   it was with a cousin of mrs  bragge  an acquaintance of mrs  suckling  a lady known at maple grove   delightful  charming  superior  first circles  spheres  lines  ranks  every thing  and mrs  elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately   on her side  all was warmth  energy  and triumph  and she positively refused to take her friend  negative  though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing  repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before    still mrs  elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow  post   how jane could bear it at all  was astonishing to emma   she did look vexed  she did speak pointedly  and at last  with a decision of action unusual to her  proposed a removal     should not they walk   would not mr  knightley shew them the gardens   all the gardens   she wished to see the whole extent    the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear   it was hot  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered  dispersed way  scarcely any three together  they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes  which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river  seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds    it led to nothing  nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars  which seemed intended  in their erection  to give the appearance of an approach to the house  which never had been there   disputable  however  as might be the taste of such a termination  it was in itself a charming walk  and the view which closed it extremely pretty   the considerable slope  at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood  gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds  and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur  well clothed with wood    and at the bottom of this bank  favourably placed and sheltered  rose the abbey mill farm  with meadows in front  and the river making a close and handsome curve around it   it was a sweet view  sweet to the eye and the mind   english verdure  english culture  english comfort  seen under a sun bright  without being oppressive   in this walk emma and mr  weston found all the others assembled  and towards this view she immediately perceived mr  knightley and harriet distinct from the rest  quietly leading the way  mr  knightley and harriet!  it was an odd tete a tete  but she was glad to see it   there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion  and turned from her with little ceremony  now they seemed in pleasant conversation   there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm  but now she feared it not  it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty  its rich pastures  spreading flocks  orchard in blossom  and light column of smoke ascending   she joined them at the wall  and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around  he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture  etc  and emma received a smile which seemed to say   these are my own concerns   i have a right to talk on such subjects  without being suspected of introducing robert martin    she did not suspect him  it was too old a story   robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet   they took a few turns together along the walk   the shade was most refreshing  and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day   the next remove was to the house  they must all go in and eat    and they were all seated and busy  and still frank churchill did not come   mrs  weston looked  and looked in vain   his father would not own himself uneasy  and laughed at her fears  but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare  he had expressed himself as to coming  with more than common certainty   his aunt was so much better  that he had not a doubt of getting over to them    mrs  churchill  state  however  as many were ready to remind her  was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence  and mrs  weston was at last persuaded to believe  or to say  that it must be by some attack of mrs  churchill that he was prevented coming    emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration  she behaved very well  and betrayed no emotion   the cold repast was over  and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen  the old abbey fish ponds  perhaps get as far as the clover  which was to be begun cutting on the morrow  or  at any rate  have the pleasure of being hot  and growing cool again   mr  woodhouse  who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens  where no damps from the river were imagined even by him  stirred no more  and his daughter resolved to remain with him  that mrs  weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need   mr  knightley had done all in his power for mr  woodhouse  entertainment   books of engravings  drawers of medals  cameos  corals  shells  and every other family collection within his cabinets  had been prepared for his old friend  to while away the morning  and the kindness had perfectly answered   mr  woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused   mrs  weston had been shewing them all to him  and now he would shew them all to emma   fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child  than in a total want of taste for what he saw  for he was slow  constant  and methodical   before this second looking over was begun  however  emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground plot of the house  and was hardly there  when jane fairfax appeared  coming quickly in from the garden  and with a look of escape    little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon  there was a start at first  but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of    will you be so kind   said she   when i am missed  as to say that i am gone home   i am going this moment   my aunt is not aware how late it is  nor how long we have been absent  but i am sure we shall be wanted  and i am determined to go directly   i have said nothing about it to any body   it would only be giving trouble and distress   some are gone to the ponds  and some to the lime walk  till they all come in i shall not be missed  and when they do  will you have the goodness to say that i am gone     certainly  if you wish it   but you are not going to walk to highbury alone     yes  what should hurt me   i walk fast   i shall be at home in twenty minutes     but it is too far  indeed it is  to be walking quite alone  let my father  servant go with you   let me order the carriage  it can be round in five minutes     thank you  thank you  but on no account   i would rather walk    and for  me  to be afraid of walking alone!  i  who may so soon have to guard others!   she spoke with great agitation  and emma very feelingly replied   that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now  i must order the carriage   the heat even would be danger   you are fatigued already     i am    she answered   i am fatigued  but it is not the sort of fatigue  quick walking will refresh me   miss woodhouse  we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits   mine  i confess  are exhausted   the greatest kindness you can shew me  will be to let me have my own way  and only say that i am gone when it is necessary    emma had not another word to oppose   she saw it all  and entering into her feelings  promoted her quitting the house immediately  and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend   her parting look was grateful  and her parting words   oh!  miss woodhouse  the comfort of being sometimes alone!   seemed to burst from an overcharged heart  and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her  even towards some of those who loved her best    such a home  indeed! such an aunt!  said emma  as she turned back into the hall again    i do pity you   and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors  the more i shall like you    jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour  and they had only accomplished some views of st  mark  place  venice  when frank churchill entered the room   emma had not been thinking of him  she had forgotten to think of him  but she was very glad to see him  mrs  weston would be at ease   the black mare was blameless   they  were right who had named mrs  churchill as the cause  he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her  a nervous seizure  which had lasted some hours  and he had quite given up every thought of coming  till very late   and had he known how hot a ride he should have  and how late  with all his hurry  he must be  he believed he should not have come at all   the heat was excessive  he had never suffered any thing like it  almost wished he had staid at home  nothing killed him like heat  he could bear any degree of cold  etc   but heat was intolerable  and he sat down  at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr  woodhouse  fire  looking very deplorable    you will soon be cooler  if you sit still   said emma    as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again   i could very ill be spared  but such a point had been made of my coming! you will all be going soon i suppose  the whole party breaking up  i met  one  as i came  madness in such weather!  absolute madness!   emma listened  and looked  and soon perceived that frank churchill  state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour   some people were always cross when they were hot  such might be his constitution  and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints  she recommended his taking some refreshment  he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room  and she humanely pointed out the door    no  he should not eat   he was not hungry  it would only make him hotter    in two minutes  however  he relented in his own favour  and muttering something about spruce beer  walked off   emma returned all her attention to her father  saying in secret     i am glad i have done being in love with him   i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning   harriet  sweet easy temper will not mind it    he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal  and came back all the better  grown quite cool  and  with good manners  like himself  able to draw a chair close to them  take an interest in their employment  and regret  in a reasonable way  that he should be so late   he was not in his best spirits  but seemed trying to improve them  and  at last  made himself talk nonsense very agreeably   they were looking over views in swisserland    as soon as my aunt gets well  i shall go abroad   said he   i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places  you will have my sketches  some time or other  to look at  or my tour to read  or my poem   i shall do something to expose myself     that may be  but not by sketches in swisserland   you will never go to swisserland   your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england     they may be induced to go too   a warm climate may be prescribed for her   i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad  i assure you i have   i feel a strong persuasion  this morning  that i shall soon be abroad   i ought to travel   i am tired of doing nothing   i want a change   i am serious  miss woodhouse  whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy  i am sick of england   and would leave it to morrow  if i could     you are sick of prosperity and indulgence   cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself  and be contented to stay      i  sick of prosperity and indulgence!  you are quite mistaken  i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged   i am thwarted in every thing material   i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person     you are not quite so miserable  though  as when you first came  go and eat and drink a little more  and you will do very well  another slice of cold meat  another draught of madeira and water  will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us     no  i shall not stir   i shall sit by you   you are my best cure     we are going to box hill to morrow   you will join us  it is not swisserland  but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change   you will stay  and go with us     no  certainly not  i shall go home in the cool of the evening     but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning     no  it will not be worth while   if i come  i shall be cross     then pray stay at richmond     but if i do  i shall be crosser still   i can never bear to think of you all there without me     these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself  chuse your own degree of crossness   i shall press you no more    the rest of the party were now returning  and all were soon collected  with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill  others took it very composedly  but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax  disappearance being explained  that it was time for every body to go  concluded the subject  and with a short final arrangement for the next day  scheme  they parted  frank churchill  little inclination to exclude himself increased so much  that his last words to emma were    well   if  you  wish me to stay and join the party  i will    she smiled her acceptance  and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening     chapter vii   they had a very fine day for box hill  and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement  accommodation  and punctuality  were in favour of a pleasant party   mr  weston directed the whole  officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage  and every body was in good time   emma and harriet went together  miss bates and her niece  with the eltons  the gentlemen on horseback  mrs  weston remained with mr  woodhouse   nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there   seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment  and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving  but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency   there was a languor  a want of spirits  a want of union  which could not be got over   they separated too much into parties  the eltons walked together  mr  knightley took charge of miss bates and jane  and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill  and mr  weston tried  in vain  to make them harmonise better   it seemed at first an accidental division  but it never materially varied  mr  and mrs  elton  indeed  shewed no unwillingness to mix  and be as agreeable as they could  but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill  there seemed a principle of separation  between the other parties  too strong for any fine prospects  or any cold collation  or any cheerful mr  weston  to remove   at first it was downright dulness to emma   she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid   he said nothing worth hearing   looked without seeing  admired without intelligence  listened without knowing what she said   while he was so dull  it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise  and they were both insufferable   when they all sat down it was better  to her taste a great deal better  for frank churchill grew talkative and gay  making her his first object  every distinguishing attention that could be paid  was paid to her  to amuse her  and be agreeable in her eyes  seemed all that he cared for  and emma  glad to be enlivened  not sorry to be flattered  was gay and easy too  and gave him all the friendly encouragement  the admission to be gallant  which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance  but which now  in her own estimation  meant nothing  though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe    mr  frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively    they were laying themselves open to that very phrase  and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady  to ireland by another  not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity  it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected  she laughed because she was disappointed  and though she liked him for his attentions  and thought them all  whether in friendship  admiration  or playfulness  extremely judicious  they were not winning back her heart   she still intended him for her friend    how much i am obliged to you   said he   for telling me to come to day!   if it had not been for you  i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party   i had quite determined to go away again     yes  you were very cross  and i do not know what about  except that you were too late for the best strawberries  i was a kinder friend than you deserved   but you were humble  you begged hard to be commanded to come     don't say i was cross   i was fatigued   the heat overcame me     it is hotter to day     not to my feelings   i am perfectly comfortable to day     you are comfortable because you are under command     your command   yes     perhaps i intended you to say so  but i meant self command  you had  somehow or other  broken bounds yesterday  and run away from your own management  but to day you are got back again  and as i cannot be always with you  it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine     it comes to the same thing   i can have no self command without a motive   you order me  whether you speak or not   and you can be always with me   you are always with me     dating from three o'clock yesterday   my perpetual influence could not begin earlier  or you would not have been so much out of humour before     three o'clock yesterday!  that is your date   i thought i had seen you first in february     your gallantry is really unanswerable   but  lowering her voice    nobody speaks except ourselves  and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people     i say nothing of which i am ashamed   replied he  with lively impudence   i saw you first in february   let every body on the hill hear me if they can   let my accents swell to mickleham on one side  and dorking on the other   i saw you first in february    and then whispering    our companions are excessively stupid   what shall we do to rouse them  any nonsense will serve   they  shall  talk   ladies and gentlemen  i am ordered by miss woodhouse  who  wherever she is  presides  to say  that she desires to know what you are all thinking of    some laughed  and answered good humouredly  miss bates said a great deal  mrs  elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse  presiding  mr  knightley  answer was the most distinct    is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of     oh! no  no   cried emma  laughing as carelessly as she could    upon no account in the world   it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now   let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of   i will not say quite all  there are one or two  perhaps   glancing at mr  weston and harriet   whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing     it is a sort of thing   cried mrs  elton emphatically   which  i  should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into   though  perhaps  as the  chaperon  of the party    i  never was in any circle  exploring parties  young ladies  married women     her mutterings were chiefly to her husband  and he murmured  in reply    very true  my love  very true   exactly so  indeed  quite unheard of   but some ladies say any thing   better pass it off as a joke  every body knows what is due to  you      it will not do   whispered frank to emma   they are most of them affronted   i will attack them with more address  ladies and gentlemen  i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say  that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of  and only requires something very entertaining from each of you  in a general way   here are seven of you  besides myself   who  she is pleased to say  am very entertaining already   and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever  be it prose or verse  original or repeated  or two things moderately clever   or three things very dull indeed  and she engages to laugh heartily at them all     oh! very well   exclaimed miss bates   then i need not be uneasy  `three things very dull indeed '  that will just do for me  you know  i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth  shan't i   looking round with the most good humoured dependence on every body  assent   do not you all think i shall    emma could not resist    ah! ma'am  but there may be a difficulty   pardon me  but you will be limited as to number  only three at once    miss bates  deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner  did not immediately catch her meaning  but  when it burst on her  it could not anger  though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her    ah!  well  to be sure   yes  i see what she means   turning to mr  knightley   and i will try to hold my tongue   i must make myself very disagreeable  or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend     i like your plan   cried mr  weston    agreed  agreed   i will do my best   i am making a conundrum   how will a conundrum reckon     low  i am afraid  sir  very low   answered his son    but we shall be indulgent  especially to any one who leads the way     no  no   said emma   it will not reckon low   a conundrum of mr  weston  shall clear him and his next neighbour   come  sir  pray let me hear it     i doubt its being very clever myself   said mr  weston   it is too much a matter of fact  but here it is   what two letters of the alphabet are there  that express perfection     what two letters!  express perfection!  i am sure i do not know     ah! you will never guess   you   to emma   i am certain  will never guess   i will tell you   m  and a   em ma   do you understand    understanding and gratification came together   it might be a very indifferent piece of wit  but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it  and so did frank and harriet   it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally  some looked very stupid about it  and mr  knightley gravely said    this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted  and mr  weston has done very well for himself  but he must have knocked up every body else    perfection  should not have come quite so soon     oh! for myself  i protest i must be excused   said mrs  elton    i  really cannot attempt  i am not at all fond of the sort of thing  i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name  which i was not at all pleased with   i knew who it came from   an abominable puppy!   you know who i mean  nodding to her husband   these kind of things are very well at christmas  when one is sitting round the fire  but quite out of place  in my opinion  when one is exploring about the country in summer   miss woodhouse must excuse me  i am not one of those who have witty things at every body  service  i do not pretend to be a wit   i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way  but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue   pass us  if you please  mr  churchill  pass mr  e   knightley  jane  and myself   we have nothing clever to say   not one of us    yes  yes  pray pass  me    added her husband  with a sort of sneering consciousness    i  have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse  or any other young lady   an old married man   quite good for nothing   shall we walk  augusta     with all my heart   i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot   come  jane  take my other arm    jane declined it  however  and the husband and wife walked off   happy couple!  said frank churchill  as soon as they were out of hearing    how well they suit one another!  very lucky  marrying as they did  upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!  they only knew each other  i think  a few weeks in bath!  peculiarly lucky!   for as to any real knowledge of a person  disposition that bath  or any public place  can give  it is all nothing  there can be no knowledge   it is only by seeing women in their own homes  among their own set  just as they always are  that you can form any just judgment   short of that  it is all guess and luck   and will generally be ill luck  how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance  and rued it all the rest of his life!   miss fairfax  who had seldom spoken before  except among her own confederates  spoke now    such things do occur  undoubtedly    she was stopped by a cough  frank churchill turned towards her to listen    you were speaking   said he  gravely   she recovered her voice    i was only going to observe  that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women  i cannot imagine them to be very frequent   a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise   but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards   i would be understood to mean  that it can be only weak  irresolute characters   whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance   who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience  an oppression for ever    he made no answer  merely looked  and bowed in submission  and soon afterwards said  in a lively tone    well  i have so little confidence in my own judgment  that whenever i marry  i hope some body will chuse my wife for me   will you   turning to emma   will you chuse a wife for me   i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you   you provide for the family  you know   with a smile at his father   find some body for me  i am in no hurry   adopt her  educate her     and make her like myself     by all means  if you can     very well   i undertake the commission   you shall have a charming wife     she must be very lively  and have hazle eyes   i care for nothing else  i shall go abroad for a couple of years  and when i return  i shall come to you for my wife   remember    emma was in no danger of forgetting   it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling   would not harriet be the very creature described  hazle eyes excepted  two years more might make her all that he wished  he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment  who could say   referring the education to her seemed to imply it    now  ma'am   said jane to her aunt   shall we join mrs  elton     if you please  my dear   with all my heart   i am quite ready  i was ready to have gone with her  but this will do just as well  we shall soon overtake her   there she is  no  that  somebody else  that  one of the ladies in the irish car party  not at all like her    well  i declare     they walked off  followed in half a minute by mr  knightley  mr  weston  his son  emma  and harriet  only remained  and the young man  spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant   even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment  and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others  or sitting almost alone  and quite unattended to  in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her   the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight  and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart  and the solicitude of mrs  elton to have  her  carriage first  were gladly endured  in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure  such another scheme  composed of so many ill assorted people  she hoped never to be betrayed into again   while waiting for the carriage  she found mr  knightley by her side  he looked around  as if to see that no one were near  and then said    emma  i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do  a privilege rather endured than allowed  perhaps  but i must still use it   i cannot see you acting wrong  without a remonstrance  how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates   how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character  age  and situation    emma  i had not thought it possible    emma recollected  blushed  was sorry  but tried to laugh it off    nay  how could i help saying what i did   nobody could have helped it  it was not so very bad   i dare say she did not understand me     i assure you she did   she felt your full meaning   she has talked of it since   i wish you could have heard how she talked of it   with what candour and generosity   i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance  in being able to pay her such attentions  as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father  when her society must be so irksome     oh!  cried emma   i know there is not a better creature in the world  but you must allow  that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her     they are blended   said he   i acknowledge  and  were she prosperous  i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good   were she a woman of fortune  i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance  i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner   were she your equal in situation   but  emma  consider how far this is from being the case   she is poor  she has sunk from the comforts she was born to  and  if she live to old age  must probably sink more   her situation should secure your compassion   it was badly done  indeed!  you  whom she had known from an infant  whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour  to have you now  in thoughtless spirits  and the pride of the moment  laugh at her  humble her  and before her niece  too  and before others  many of whom  certainly  some    would be entirely guided by  your  treatment of her   this is not pleasant to you  emma  and it is very far from pleasant to me  but i must  i will   i will tell you truths while i can  satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel  and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now    while they talked  they were advancing towards the carriage  it was ready  and  before she could speak again  he had handed her in  he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted  and her tongue motionless   they were combined only of anger against herself  mortification  and deep concern   she had not been able to speak  and  on entering the carriage  sunk back for a moment overcome  then reproaching herself for having taken no leave  making no acknowledgment  parting in apparent sullenness  she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference  but it was just too late   he had turned away  and the horses were in motion   she continued to look back  but in vain  and soon  with what appeared unusual speed  they were half way down the hill  and every thing left far behind   she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed  almost beyond what she could conceal  never had she felt so agitated  mortified  grieved  at any circumstance in her life   she was most forcibly struck   the truth of this representation there was no denying   she felt it at her heart  how could she have been so brutal  so cruel to miss bates!  how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude  of concurrence  of common kindness!  time did not compose her   as she reflected more  she seemed but to feel it more   she never had been so depressed   happily it was not necessary to speak   there was only harriet  who seemed not in spirits herself  fagged  and very willing to be silent  and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home  without being at any trouble to check them  extraordinary as they were     chapter viii   the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma  thoughts all the evening   how it might be considered by the rest of the party  she could not tell   they  in their different homes  and their different ways  might be looking back on it with pleasure  but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent  more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time  and more to be abhorred in recollection  than any she had ever passed   a whole evening of back gammon with her father  was felicity to it    there   indeed  lay real pleasure  for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort  and feeling that  unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem  she could not  in her general conduct  be open to any severe reproach   as a daughter  she hoped she was not without a heart   she hoped no one could have said to her   how could you be so unfeeling to your father    i must  i will tell you truths while i can    miss bates should never again  no  never!  if attention  in future  could do away the past  she might hope to be forgiven   she had been often remiss  her conscience told her so  remiss  perhaps  more in thought than fact  scornful  ungracious   but it should be so no more  in the warmth of true contrition  she would call upon her the very next morning  and it should be the beginning  on her side  of a regular  equal  kindly intercourse   she was just as determined when the morrow came  and went early  that nothing might prevent her   it was not unlikely  she thought  that she might see mr  knightley in her way  or  perhaps  he might come in while she were paying her visit   she had no objection  she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence  so justly and truly hers   her eyes were towards donwell as she walked  but she saw him not    the ladies were all at home    she had never rejoiced at the sound before  nor ever before entered the passage  nor walked up the stairs  with any wish of giving pleasure  but in conferring obligation  or of deriving it  except in subsequent ridicule   there was a bustle on her approach  a good deal of moving and talking  she heard miss bates  voice  something was to be done in a hurry  the maid looked frightened and awkward  hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment  and then ushered her in too soon   the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room   jane she had a distinct glimpse of  looking extremely ill  and  before the door had shut them out  she heard miss bates saying   well  my dear  i shall  say  you are laid down upon the bed  and i am sure you are ill enough    poor old mrs  bates  civil and humble as usual  looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on    i am afraid jane is not very well   said she   but i do not know  they  tell  me she is well   i dare say my daughter will be here presently  miss woodhouse   i hope you find a chair   i wish hetty had not gone  i am very little able  have you a chair  ma'am  do you sit where you like   i am sure she will be here presently    emma seriously hoped she would   she had a moment  fear of miss bates keeping away from her   but miss bates soon came   very happy and obliged   but emma  conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before  less ease of look and manner  a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax  she hoped  might lead the way to a return of old feelings   the touch seemed immediate    ah!  miss woodhouse  how kind you are!  i suppose you have heard   and are come to give us joy   this does not seem much like joy  indeed  in me   twinkling away a tear or two   but it will be very trying for us to part with her  after having had her so long  and she has a dreadful headache just now  writing all the morning    such long letters  you know  to be written to colonel campbell  and mrs  dixon   `my dear ' said i  `you will blind yourself'   for tears were in her eyes perpetually   one cannot wonder  one cannot wonder   it is a great change  and though she is amazingly fortunate  such a situation  i suppose  as no young woman before ever met with on first going out  do not think us ungrateful  miss woodhouse  for such surprising good fortune   again dispersing her tears   but  poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has   when one is in great pain  you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve   she is as low as possible  to look at her  nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation   you will excuse her not coming to you  she is not able  she is gone into her own room   i want her to lie down upon the bed   `my dear ' said i  `i shall say you are laid down upon the bed '  but  however  she is not  she is walking about the room   but  now that she has written her letters  she says she shall soon be well   she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you  miss woodhouse  but your kindness will excuse her   you were kept waiting at the door  i was quite ashamed   but somehow there was a little bustle  for it so happened that we had not heard the knock  and till you were on the stairs  we did not know any body was coming   `it is only mrs  cole ' said i  `depend upon it   nobody else would come so early '  `well ' said she  `it must be borne some time or other  and it may as well be now ' but then patty came in  and said it was you   `oh!' said i  `it is miss woodhouse   i am sure you will like to see her '   `i can see nobody ' said she  and up she got  and would go away  and that was what made us keep you waiting  and extremely sorry and ashamed we were   `if you must go  my dear ' said i  `you must  and i will say you are laid down upon the bed '   emma was most sincerely interested   her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane  and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion  and left her nothing but pity  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past  obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs  cole or any other steady friend  when she might not bear to see herself   she spoke as she felt  with earnest regret and solicitude  sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on  might be as much for miss fairfax  advantage and comfort as possible    it must be a severe trial to them all  she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell  return     so very kind!  replied miss bates    but you are always kind    there was no bearing such an  always   and to break through her dreadful gratitude  emma made the direct inquiry of     where  may i ask   is miss fairfax going     to a mrs  smallridge  charming woman  most superior  to have the charge of her three little girls  delightful children  impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort  if we except  perhaps  mrs  suckling  own family  and mrs  bragge   but mrs  smallridge is intimate with both  and in the very same neighbourhood   lives only four miles from maple grove  jane will be only four miles from maple grove     mrs  elton  i suppose  has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes      yes  our good mrs  elton   the most indefatigable  true friend  she would not take a denial   she would not let jane say  `no ' for when jane first heard of it   it was the day before yesterday  the very morning we were at donwell   when jane first heard of it  she was quite decided against accepting the offer  and for the reasons you mention  exactly as you say  she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell  return  and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present  and so she told mrs  elton over and over again  and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind!  but that good mrs  elton  whose judgment never fails her  saw farther than i did   it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did  and refuse to take jane  answer  but she positively declared she would  not  write any such denial yesterday  as jane wished her  she would wait  and  sure enough  yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go   quite a surprize to me!  i had not the least idea!  jane took mrs  elton aside  and told her at once  that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs  smallridge  situation  she had come to the resolution of accepting it   i did not know a word of it till it was all settled     you spent the evening with mrs  elton     yes  all of us  mrs  elton would have us come   it was settled so  upon the hill  while we were walking about with mr  knightley  `you  must   all  spend your evening with us ' said she  `i positively must have you  all  come '    mr  knightley was there too  was he     no  not mr  knightley  he declined it from the first  and though i thought he would come  because mrs  elton declared she would not let him off  he did not   but my mother  and jane  and i  were all there  and a very agreeable evening we had   such kind friends  you know  miss woodhouse  one must always find agreeable  though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning  party   even pleasure  you know  is fatiguing  and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it   however   i  shall always think it a very pleasant party  and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it     miss fairfax  i suppose  though you were not aware of it  had been making up her mind the whole day     i dare say she had     whenever the time may come  it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends  but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible  i mean  as to the character and manners of the family     thank you  dear miss woodhouse   yes  indeed  there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it   except the sucklings and bragges  there is not such another nursery establishment  so liberal and elegant  in all mrs  elton  acquaintance  mrs  smallridge  a most delightful woman!  a style of living almost equal to maple grove  and as to the children  except the little sucklings and little bragges  there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere   jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!   it will be nothing but pleasure  a life of pleasure   and her salary!   i really cannot venture to name her salary to you  miss woodhouse  even you  used as you are to great sums  would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane     ah! madam   cried emma   if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself  i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions  dearly earned     you are so noble in your ideas!    and when is miss fairfax to leave you     very soon  very soon  indeed  that  the worst of it  within a fortnight   mrs  smallridge is in a great hurry   my poor mother does not know how to bear it   so then  i try to put it out of her thoughts  and say  come ma'am  do not let us think about it any more     her friends must all be sorry to lose her  and will not colonel and mrs  campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return     yes  jane says she is sure they will  but yet  this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining  i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs  elton  and when mrs  elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it!  it was before tea  stay  no  it could not be before tea  because we were just going to cards  and yet it was before tea  because i remember thinking  oh! no  now i recollect  now i have it  something happened before tea  but not that   mr  elton was called out of the room before tea  old john abdy  son wanted to speak with him   poor old john  i have a great regard for him  he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years  and now  poor old man  he is bed ridden  and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints   i must go and see him to day  and so will jane  i am sure  if she gets out at all   and poor john  son came to talk to mr  elton about relief from the parish  he is very well to do himself  you know  being head man at the crown  ostler  and every thing of that sort  but still he cannot keep his father without some help  and so  when mr  elton came back  he told us what john ostler had been telling him  and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr  frank churchill to richmond  that was what happened before tea   it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs  elton    miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her  but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr  frank churchill  going  she proceeded to give them all  it was of no consequence   what mr  elton had learned from the ostler on the subject  being the accumulation of the ostler  own knowledge  and the knowledge of the servants at randalls  was  that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill   which messenger  however  had been no more than was expected  and that mr  churchill had sent his nephew a few lines  containing  upon the whole  a tolerable account of mrs  churchill  and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early  but that mr  frank churchill having resolved to go home directly  without waiting at all  and his horse seeming to have got a cold  tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise  and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by  the boy going a good pace  and driving very steady   there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest  and it caught emma  attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind   the contrast between mrs  churchill  importance in the world  and jane fairfax   struck her  one was every thing  the other nothing  and she sat musing on the difference of woman  destiny  and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed  till roused by miss bates  saying    aye  i see what you are thinking of  the pianoforte   what is to become of that   very true   poor dear jane was talking of it just now    `you must go ' said she   `you and i must part   you will have no business here   let it stay  however ' said she  `give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back   i shall talk about it to him  he will settle for me  he will help me out of all my difficulties '   and to this day  i do believe  she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter     now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte  and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing  that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough  and  with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt  took leave     chapter ix   emma  pensive meditations  as she walked home  were not interrupted  but on entering the parlour  she found those who must rouse her  mr  knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence  and were sitting with her father   mr  knightley immediately got up  and in a manner decidedly graver than usual  said    i would not go away without seeing you  but i have no time to spare  and therefore must now be gone directly   i am going to london  to spend a few days with john and isabella   have you any thing to send or say  besides the `love ' which nobody carries     nothing at all   but is not this a sudden scheme     yes  rather  i have been thinking of it some little time    emma was sure he had not forgiven her  he looked unlike himself  time  however  she thought  would tell him that they ought to be friends again   while he stood  as if meaning to go  but not going   her father began his inquiries    well  my dear  and did you get there safely   and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter   i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming   dear emma has been to call on mrs  and miss bates  mr  knightley  as i told you before  she is always so attentive to them!   emma  colour was heightened by this unjust praise  and with a smile  and shake of the head  which spoke much  she looked at mr  knightley    it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour  as if his eyes received the truth from her   and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured    he looked at her with a glow of regard   she was warmly gratified   and in another moment still more so  by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part   he took her hand    whether she had not herself made the first motion  she could not say   she might  perhaps  have rather offered it  but he took her hand  pressed it  and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips   when  from some fancy or other  he suddenly let it go   why he should feel such a scruple  why he should change his mind when it was all but done  she could not perceive   he would have judged better  she thought  if he had not stopped   the intention  however  was indubitable  and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry  or however else it happened  but she thought nothing became him more    it was with him  of so simple  yet so dignified a nature    she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction  it spoke such perfect amity   he left them immediately afterwards   gone in a moment   he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory  but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance   emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates  but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier   it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax  situation with mr  knightley    neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square  for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed  but it might have happened at a better time  and to have had longer notice of it  would have been pleasanter   they parted thorough friends  however  she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance  and his unfinished gallantry   it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion   he had been sitting with them half an hour  she found   it was a pity that she had not come back earlier!  in the hope of diverting her father  thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr  knightley  going to london  and going so suddenly  and going on horseback  which she knew would be all very bad  emma communicated her news of jane fairfax  and her dependence on the effect was justified  it supplied a very useful check    interested  without disturbing him   he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax  going out as governess  and could talk of it cheerfully  but mr  knightley  going to london had been an unexpected blow    i am very glad  indeed  my dear  to hear she is to be so comfortably settled   mrs  elton is very good natured and agreeable  and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be   i hope it is a dry situation  and that her health will be taken good care of   it ought to be a first object  as i am sure poor miss taylor  always was with me   you know  my dear  she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us   and i hope she will be better off in one respect  and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long    the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background   an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs  churchill!  though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account  she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return  a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state  had carried her off after a short struggle  the great mrs  churchill was no more   it was felt as such things must be felt   every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow  tenderness towards the departed  solicitude for the surviving friends  and  in a reasonable time  curiosity to know where she would be buried   goldsmith tells us  that when lovely woman stoops to folly  she has nothing to do but to die  and when she stoops to be disagreeable  it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame  mrs  churchill  after being disliked at least twenty five years  was now spoken of with compassionate allowances   in one point she was fully justified  she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill   the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness  and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints    poor mrs  churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal  more than any body had ever supposed  and continual pain would try the temper   it was a sad event  a great shock  with all her faults  what would mr  churchill do without her   mr  churchill  loss would be dreadful indeed   mr  churchill would never get over it     even mr  weston shook his head  and looked solemn  and said   ah! poor woman  who would have thought it!  and resolved  that his mourning should be as handsome as possible  and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense  true and steady   how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both   it was also a very early speculation with emma  the character of mrs  churchill  the grief of her husband  her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion  and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event  how benefited  how freed   she saw in a moment all the possible good  now  an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter  mr  churchill  independent of his wife  was feared by nobody  an easy  guidable man  to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew  all that remained to be wished was  that the nephew should form the attachment  as  with all her goodwill in the cause  emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed   harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion  with great self command  what ever she might feel of brighter hope  she betrayed nothing   emma was gratified  to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character  and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance  they spoke  therefore  of mrs  churchill  death with mutual forbearance   short letters from frank were received at randalls  communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans  mr  churchill was better than could be expected  and their first removal  on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire  was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor  to whom mr  churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years  at present  there was nothing to be done for harriet  good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma  side   it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax  whose prospects were closing  while harriet  opened  and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury  who wished to shew her kindness  and with emma it was grown into a first wish  she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness  and the person  whom she had been so many months neglecting  was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy   she wanted to be of use to her  wanted to shew a value for her society  and testify respect and consideration  she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield  a note was written to urge it   the invitation was refused  and by a verbal message    miss fairfax was not well enough to write   and when mr  perry called at hartfield  the same morning  it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited  though against her own consent  by himself  and that she was suffering under severe headaches  and a nervous fever to a degree  which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs  smallridge  at the time proposed   her health seemed for the moment completely deranged   appetite quite gone  and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms  nothing touching the pulmonary complaint  which was the standing apprehension of the family  mr  perry was uneasy about her   he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to  and that she felt it so herself  though she would not own it   her spirits seemed overcome   her present home  he could not but observe  was unfavourable to a nervous disorder    confined always to one room   he could have wished it otherwise   and her good aunt  though his very old friend  he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description  her care and attention could not be questioned  they were  in fact  only too great   he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them   emma listened with the warmest concern  grieved for her more and more  and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful   to take her  be it only an hour or two  from her aunt  to give her change of air and scene  and quiet rational conversation  even for an hour or two  might do her good  and the following morning she wrote again to say  in the most feeling language she could command  that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name   mentioning that she had mr  perry  decided opinion  in favour of such exercise for his patient   the answer was only in this short note    miss fairfax  compliments and thanks  but is quite unequal to any exercise    emma felt that her own note had deserved something better  but it was impossible to quarrel with words  whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly  and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted  in spite of the answer  therefore  she ordered the carriage  and drove to mrs  bates   in the hope that jane would be induced to join her   but it would not do   miss bates came to the carriage door  all gratitude  and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service  and every thing that message could do was tried   but all in vain   miss bates was obliged to return without success  jane was quite unpersuadable  the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse   emma wished she could have seen her  and tried her own powers  but  almost before she could hint the wish  miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in    indeed  the truth was  that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body  any body at all   mrs  elton  indeed  could not be denied  and mrs  cole had made such a point  and mrs  perry had said so much  but  except them  jane would really see nobody    emma did not want to be classed with the mrs  eltons  the mrs  perrys  and the mrs  coles  who would force themselves anywhere  neither could she feel any right of preference herself   she submitted  therefore  and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece  appetite and diet  which she longed to be able to assist   on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy  and very communicative  jane would hardly eat any thing    mr  perry recommended nourishing food  but every thing they could command  and never had any body such good neighbours  was distasteful   emma  on reaching home  called the housekeeper directly  to an examination of her stores  and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note  in half an hour the arrowroot was returned  with a thousand thanks from miss bates  but  dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back  it was a thing she could not take  and  moreover  she insisted on her saying  that she was not at all in want of any thing    when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows  at some distance from highbury  on the afternoon of the very day on which she had  under the plea of being unequal to any exercise  so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage  she could have no doubt  putting every thing together   that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from  her    she was sorry  very sorry   her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits  inconsistency of action  and inequality of powers  and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling  or esteemed so little worthy as a friend   but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good  and of being able to say to herself  that could mr  knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax  could he even have seen into her heart  he would not  on this occasion  have found any thing to reprove     chapter x   one morning  about ten days after mrs  churchill  decease  emma was called downstairs to mr  weston  who  could not stay five minutes  and wanted particularly to speak with her     he met her at the parlour door  and hardly asking her how she did  in the natural key of his voice  sunk it immediately  to say  unheard by her father    can you come to randalls at any time this morning   do  if it be possible   mrs  weston wants to see you   she must see you     is she unwell     no  no  not at all  only a little agitated   she would have ordered the carriage  and come to you  but she must see you  alone   and that you know   nodding towards her father   humph!  can you come     certainly   this moment  if you please   it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way   but what can be the matter    is she really not ill     depend upon me  but ask no more questions   you will know it all in time   the most unaccountable business!  but hush  hush!   to guess what all this meant  was impossible even for emma  something really important seemed announced by his looks  but  as her friend was well  she endeavoured not to be uneasy  and settling it with her father  that she would take her walk now  she and mr  weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls    now    said emma  when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates     now mr  weston  do let me know what has happened     no  no    he gravely replied    don't ask me   i promised my wife to leave it all to her   she will break it to you better than i can  do not be impatient  emma  it will all come out too soon     break it to me   cried emma  standing still with terror     good god!  mr  weston  tell me at once   something has happened in brunswick square   i know it has   tell me  i charge you tell me this moment what it is     no  indeed you are mistaken       mr  weston do not trifle with me   consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square   which of them is it    i charge you by all that is sacred  not to attempt concealment     upon my word  emma       your word!  why not your honour!  why not say upon your honour  that it has nothing to do with any of them   good heavens!  what can be to be  broke  to me  that does not relate to one of that family     upon my honour   said he very seriously   it does not   it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley    emma  courage returned  and she walked on    i was wrong   he continued   in talking of its being  broke  to you  i should not have used the expression   in fact  it does not concern you   it concerns only myself   that is  we hope   humph!  in short  my dear emma  there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it  i don't say that it is not a disagreeable business  but things might be much worse   if we walk fast  we shall soon be at randalls    emma found that she must wait  and now it required little effort  she asked no more questions therefore  merely employed her own fancy  and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern  something just come to light  of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family   something which the late event at richmond had brought forward   her fancy was very active  half a dozen natural children  perhaps  and poor frank cut off!   this  though very undesirable  would be no matter of agony to her  it inspired little more than an animating curiosity    who is that gentleman on horseback   said she  as they proceeded   speaking more to assist mr  weston in keeping his secret  than with any other view    i do not know   one of the otways   not frank   it is not frank  i assure you   you will not see him   he is half way to windsor by this time     has your son been with you  then     oh! yes  did not you know   well  well  never mind    for a moment he was silent  and then added  in a tone much more guarded and demure    yes  frank came over this morning  just to ask us how we did    they hurried on  and were speedily at randalls    well  my dear   said he  as they entered the room   i have brought her  and now i hope you will soon be better   i shall leave you together  there is no use in delay   i shall not be far off  if you want me     and emma distinctly heard him add  in a lower tone  before he quitted the room    i have been as good as my word   she has not the least idea    mrs  weston was looking so ill  and had an air of so much perturbation  that emma  uneasiness increased  and the moment they were alone  she eagerly said    what is it my dear friend   something of a very unpleasant nature  i find  has occurred   do let me know directly what it is  i have been walking all this way in complete suspense   we both abhor suspense   do not let mine continue longer   it will do you good to speak of your distress  whatever it may be     have you indeed no idea   said mrs  weston in a trembling voice   cannot you  my dear emma  cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear     so far as that it relates to mr  frank churchill  i do guess     you are right   it does relate to him  and i will tell you directly    resuming her work  and seeming resolved against looking up    he has been here this very morning  on a most extraordinary errand  it is impossible to express our surprize   he came to speak to his father on a subject   to announce an attachment     she stopped to breathe   emma thought first of herself  and then of harriet    more than an attachment  indeed   resumed mrs  weston   an engagement   a positive engagement   what will you say  emma  what will any body say  when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged   nay  that they have been long engaged!   emma even jumped with surprize   and  horror struck  exclaimed    jane fairfax!  good god!  you are not serious   you do not mean it     you may well be amazed   returned mrs  weston  still averting her eyes  and talking on with eagerness  that emma might have time to recover    you may well be amazed   but it is even so   there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october  formed at weymouth  and kept a secret from every body   not a creature knowing it but themselves  neither the campbells  nor her family  nor his    it is so wonderful  that though perfectly convinced of the fact  it is yet almost incredible to myself   i can hardly believe it    i thought i knew him    emma scarcely heard what was said   her mind was divided between two ideas  her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax  and poor harriet   and for some time she could only exclaim  and require confirmation  repeated confirmation    well   said she at last  trying to recover herself   this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day  before i can at all comprehend it   what!  engaged to her all the winter   before either of them came to highbury     engaged since october   secretly engaged   it has hurt me  emma  very much   it has hurt his father equally    some   part  of his conduct we cannot excuse    emma pondered a moment  and then replied   i will not pretend  not  to understand you  and to give you all the relief in my power  be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me  as you are apprehensive of    mrs  weston looked up  afraid to believe  but emma  countenance was as steady as her words    that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast  of my present perfect indifference   she continued   i will farther tell you  that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance  when i did like him  when i was very much disposed to be attached to him  nay  was attached  and how it came to cease  is perhaps the wonder   fortunately  however  it did cease  i have really for some time past  for at least these three months  cared nothing about him   you may believe me  mrs  weston  this is the simple truth    mrs  weston kissed her with tears of joy  and when she could find utterance  assured her  that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do    mr  weston will be almost as much relieved as myself   said she   on this point we have been wretched   it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other  and we were persuaded that it was so    imagine what we have been feeling on your account     i have escaped  and that i should escape  may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself   but this does not acquit  him   mrs  weston  and i must say  that i think him greatly to blame  what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged  and with manners so  very  disengaged   what right had he to endeavour to please  as he certainly did  to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention  as he certainly did  while he really belonged to another   how could he tell what mischief he might be doing    how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him    very wrong  very wrong indeed     from something that he said  my dear emma  i rather imagine      and how could  she  bear such behaviour!  composure with a witness! to look on  while repeated attentions were offering to another woman  before her face  and not resent it   that is a degree of placidity  which i can neither comprehend nor respect     there were misunderstandings between them  emma  he said so expressly   he had not time to enter into much explanation  he was here only a quarter of an hour  and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay   but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said  the present crisis  indeed  seemed to be brought on by them  and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct     impropriety!  oh!  mrs  weston  it is too calm a censure  much  much beyond impropriety!  it has sunk him  i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion   so unlike what a man should be!   none of that upright integrity  that strict adherence to truth and principle  that disdain of trick and littleness  which a man should display in every transaction of his life     nay  dear emma  now i must take his part  for though he has been wrong in this instance  i have known him long enough to answer for his having many  very many  good qualities  and      good god!  cried emma  not attending to her    mrs  smallridge  too! jane actually on the point of going as governess!  what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy   to suffer her to engage herself   to suffer her even to think of such a measure!    he knew nothing about it  emma   on this article i can fully acquit him   it was a private resolution of hers  not communicated to him  or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction    till yesterday  i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans  they burst on him  i do not know how  but by some letter or message   and it was the discovery of what she was doing  of this very project of hers  which determined him to come forward at once  own it all to his uncle  throw himself on his kindness  and  in short  put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long    emma began to listen better    i am to hear from him soon   continued mrs  weston    he told me at parting  that he should soon write  and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now  let us wait  therefore  for this letter   it may bring many extenuations  it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood   don't let us be severe  don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him   let us have patience   i must love him  and now that i am satisfied on one point  the one material point  i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well  and ready to hope that it may   they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment      his  sufferings   replied emma dryly   do not appear to have done him much harm   well  and how did mr  churchill take it     most favourably for his nephew  gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty   conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!  while poor mrs  churchill lived  i suppose there could not have been a hope  a chance  a possibility   but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault  than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required  what a blessing it is  when undue influence does not survive the grave!   he gave his consent with very little persuasion     ah!  thought emma   he would have done as much for harriet     this was settled last night  and frank was off with the light this morning   he stopped at highbury  at the bates   i fancy  some time  and then came on hither  but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle  to whom he is just now more necessary than ever  that  as i tell you  he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour    he was very much agitated  very much  indeed  to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before   in addition to all the rest  there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell  which he had had no previous suspicion of   and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal     and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy   the campbells  the dixons  did none of them know of the engagement    emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush    none  not one   he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves     well   said emma   i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea  and i wish them very happy   but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding   what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit   espionage  and treachery    to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity  and such a league in secret to judge us all!  here have we been  the whole winter and spring  completely duped  fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour  with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round  comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear   they must take the consequence  if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!    i am quite easy on that head   replied mrs  weston    i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other  which both might not have heard     you are in luck   your only blunder was confined to my ear  when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady     true   but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax  i never could  under any blunder  have spoken ill of her  and as to speaking ill of him  there i must have been safe    at this moment mr  weston appeared at a little distance from the window  evidently on the watch   his wife gave him a look which invited him in  and  while he was coming round  added   now  dearest emma  let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease  and incline him to be satisfied with the match  let us make the best of it  and  indeed  almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour   it is not a connexion to gratify  but if mr  churchill does not feel that  why should we  and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him  for frank  i mean  that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for   and still am disposed to give her credit for  in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right   and how much may be said in her situation for even that error!    much  indeed!  cried emma feelingly    if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself  it is in a situation like jane fairfax    of such  one may almost say  that `the world is not their   nor the world  law '   she met mr  weston on his entrance  with a smiling countenance  exclaiming    a very pretty trick you have been playing me  upon my word! this was a device  i suppose  to sport with my curiosity  and exercise my talent of guessing   but you really frightened me  i thought you had lost half your property  at least   and here  instead of its being a matter of condolence  it turns out to be one of congratulation   i congratulate you  mr  weston  with all my heart  on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter    a glance or two between him and his wife  convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed  and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate   his air and voice recovered their usual briskness  he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand  and entered on the subject in a manner to prove  that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing  his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence  or smooth objections  and by the time they had talked it all over together  and he had talked it all over again with emma  in their walk back to hartfield  he was become perfectly reconciled  and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done     chapter xi    harriet  poor harriet!   those were the words  in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of  and which constituted the real misery of the business to her   frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself  very ill in many ways   but it was not so much  his  behaviour as her  own   which made her so angry with him  it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet  account  that gave the deepest hue to his offence   poor harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery   mr  knightley had spoken prophetically  when he once said   emma  you have been no friend to harriet smith    she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice   it was true that she had not to charge herself  in this instance as in the former  with being the sole and original author of the mischief  with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet  imagination  for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject  but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed  she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments  her influence would have been enough   and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them   she felt that she had been risking her friend  happiness on most insufficient grounds  common sense would have directed her to tell harriet  that she must not allow herself to think of him  and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her    but  with common sense   she added   i am afraid i have had little to do    she was extremely angry with herself   if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too  it would have been dreadful    as for jane fairfax  she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account   harriet would be anxiety enough  she need no longer be unhappy about jane  whose troubles and whose ill health having  of course  the same origin  must be equally under cure   her days of insignificance and evil were over   she would soon be well  and happy  and prosperous    emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted  this discovery laid many smaller matters open   no doubt it had been from jealousy   in jane  eyes she had been a rival  and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed  an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack  and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison  she understood it all  and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings  she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert   but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge! there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else  emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first   considering the very superior claims of the object  it ought  and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet  mind  producing reserve and self command  it would    she must communicate the painful truth  however  and as soon as possible   an injunction of secresy had been among mr  weston  parting words    for the present  the whole affair was to be completely a secret   mr  churchill had made a point of it  as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost  and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum     emma had promised  but still harriet must be excepted   it was her superior duty   in spite of her vexation  she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous  that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet  which mrs  weston had just gone through by herself  the intelligence  which had been so anxiously announced to her  she was now to be anxiously announcing to another   her heart beat quick on hearing harriet  footstep and voice  so  she supposed  had poor mrs  weston felt when  she  was approaching randalls  could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!   but of that  unfortunately  there could be no chance    well  miss woodhouse!  cried harriet  coming eagerly into the room    is not this the oddest news that ever was     what news do you mean   replied emma  unable to guess  by look or voice  whether harriet could indeed have received any hint    about jane fairfax   did you ever hear any thing so strange  oh!  you need not be afraid of owning it to me  for mr  weston has told me himself   i met him just now   he told me it was to be a great secret  and  therefore  i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you  but he said you knew it     what did mr  weston tell you    said emma  still perplexed    oh! he told me all about it  that jane fairfax and mr  frank churchill are to be married  and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while   how very odd!   it was  indeed  so odd  harriet  behaviour was so extremely odd  that emma did not know how to understand it   her character appeared absolutely changed   she seemed to propose shewing no agitation  or disappointment  or peculiar concern in the discovery   emma looked at her  quite unable to speak    had you any idea   cried harriet   of his being in love with her   you  perhaps  might   you  blushing as she spoke  who can see into every body  heart  but nobody else      upon my word   said emma   i begin to doubt my having any such talent  can you seriously ask me  harriet  whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was  tacitly  if not openly   encouraging you to give way to your own feelings   i never had the slightest suspicion  till within the last hour  of mr  frank churchill  having the least regard for jane fairfax   you may be very sure that if i had  i should have cautioned you accordingly     me!  cried harriet  colouring  and astonished    why should you caution me   you do not think i care about mr  frank churchill     i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject   replied emma  smiling   but you do not mean to deny that there was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him     him!  never  never   dear miss woodhouse  how could you so mistake me   turning away distressed    harriet!  cried emma  after a moment  pause   what do you mean    good heaven! what do you mean   mistake you!  am i to suppose then      she could not speak another word   her voice was lost  and she sat down  waiting in great terror till harriet should answer   harriet  who was standing at some distance  and with face turned from her  did not immediately say any thing  and when she did speak  it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma     i should not have thought it possible   she began   that you could have misunderstood me!  i know we agreed never to name him   but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else  i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person   mr  frank churchill  indeed!  i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other  i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr  frank churchill  who is like nobody by his side   and that you should have been so mistaken  is amazing!  i am sure  but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment  i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost  to dare to think of him   at first  if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened  that there had been matches of greater disparity  those were your very words     i should not have dared to give way to  i should not have thought it possible  but if  you   who had been always acquainted with him      harriet!  cried emma  collecting herself resolutely   let us understand each other now  without the possibility of farther mistake  are you speaking of  mr  knightley     to be sure i am   i never could have an idea of any body else   and so i thought you knew   when we talked about him  it was as clear as possible     not quite   returned emma  with forced calmness   for all that you then said  appeared to me to relate to a different person  i could almost assert that you had  named  mr  frank churchill  i am sure the service mr  frank churchill had rendered you  in protecting you from the gipsies  was spoken of     oh!  miss woodhouse  how you do forget!    my dear harriet  i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion   i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment  that considering the service he had rendered you  it was extremely natural   and you agreed to it  expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service  and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue   the impression of it is strong on my memory     oh  dear   cried harriet   now i recollect what you mean  but i was thinking of something very different at the time   it was not the gipsies  it was not mr  frank churchill that i meant   no!  with some elevation  i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance   of mr  knightley  coming and asking me to dance  when mr  elton would not stand up with me  and when there was no other partner in the room   that was the kind action  that was the noble benevolence and generosity  that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth     good god!  cried emma   this has been a most unfortunate   most deplorable mistake!  what is to be done     you would not have encouraged me  then  if you had understood me  at least  however  i cannot be worse off than i should have been  if the other had been the person  and now  it  is  possible     she paused a few moments   emma could not speak    i do not wonder  miss woodhouse   she resumed   that you should feel a great difference between the two  as to me or as to any body  you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other   but i hope  miss woodhouse  that supposing  that if   strange as it may appear     but you know they were your own words  that  more  wonderful things had happened  matches of  greater  disparity had taken place than between mr  frank churchill and me  and  therefore  it seems as if such a thing even as this  may have occurred before   and if i should be so fortunate  beyond expression  as to   if mr  knightley should really  if  he  does not mind the disparity  i hope  dear miss woodhouse  you will not set yourself against it  and try to put difficulties in the way   but you are too good for that  i am sure    harriet was standing at one of the windows   emma turned round to look at her in consternation  and hastily said    have you any idea of mr  knightley  returning your affection     yes   replied harriet modestly  but not fearfully   i must say that i have    emma  eyes were instantly withdrawn  and she sat silently meditating  in a fixed attitude  for a few minutes   a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart   a mind like hers  once opening to suspicion  made rapid progress   she touched   she admitted  she acknowledged the whole truth   why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr  knightley  than with frank churchill   why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet  having some hope of a return   it darted through her  with the speed of an arrow  that mr  knightley must marry no one but herself!  her own conduct  as well as her own heart  was before her in the same few minutes   she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before   how improperly had she been acting by harriet!  how inconsiderate  how indelicate  how irrational  how unfeeling had been her conduct!  what blindness  what madness  had led her on!  it struck her with dreadful force  and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world   some portion of respect for herself  however  in spite of all these demerits   some concern for her own appearance  and a strong sense of justice by harriet   there would be no need of  compassion  to the girl who believed herself loved by mr  knightley  but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now   gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness  with even apparent kindness   for her own advantage indeed  it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet  hopes should be enquired into  and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained  or to deserve to be slighted by the person  whose counsels had never led her right    rousing from reflection  therefore  and subduing her emotion  she turned to harriet again  and  in a more inviting accent  renewed the conversation  for as to the subject which had first introduced it  the wonderful story of jane fairfax  that was quite sunk and lost    neither of them thought but of mr  knightley and themselves   harriet  who had been standing in no unhappy reverie  was yet very glad to be called from it  by the now encouraging manner of such a judge  and such a friend as miss woodhouse  and only wanted invitation  to give the history of her hopes with great  though trembling delight   emma  tremblings as she asked  and as she listened  were better concealed than harriet   but they were not less  her voice was not unsteady  but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self  such a burst of threatening evil  such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions  must create    she listened with much inward suffering  but with great outward patience  to harriet  detail   methodical  or well arranged  or very well delivered  it could not be expected to be  but it contained  when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration  a substance to sink her spirit   especially with the corroborating circumstances  which her own memory brought in favour of mr  knightley  most improved opinion of harriet   harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances   emma knew that he had  on that occasion  found her much superior to his expectation   from that evening  or at least from the time of miss woodhouse  encouraging her to think of him  harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do  and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her  a manner of kindness and sweetness!  latterly she had been more and more aware of it  when they had been all walking together  he had so often come and walked by her  and talked so very delightfully!  he seemed to want to be acquainted with her   emma knew it to have been very much the case  she had often observed the change  to almost the same extent    harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him   and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet   he praised her for being without art or affectation  for having simple  honest  generous  feelings    she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet  he had dwelt on them to her more than once   much that lived in harriet  memory  many little particulars of the notice she had received from him  a look  a speech  a removal from one chair to another  a compliment implied  a preference inferred  had been unnoticed  because unsuspected  by emma   circumstances that might swell to half an hour  relation  and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them  had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them  but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned  the two of strongest promise to harriet  were not without some degree of witness from emma herself   the first  was his walking with her apart from the others  in the lime walk at donwell  where they had been walking some time before emma came  and he had taken pains  as she was convinced  to draw her from the rest to himself  and at first  he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before  in a very particular way indeed!   harriet could not recall it without a blush   he seemed to be almost asking her  whether her affections were engaged    but as soon as she  miss woodhouse  appeared likely to join them  he changed the subject  and began talking about farming    the second  was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit  the very last morning of his being at hartfield  though  when he first came in  he had said that he could not stay five minutes  and his having told her  during their conversation  that though he must go to london  it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all  which was much more  as emma felt  than he had acknowledged to  her   the superior degree of confidence towards harriet  which this one article marked  gave her severe pain   on the subject of the first of the two circumstances  she did  after a little reflection  venture the following question   might he not   is not it possible  that when enquiring  as you thought  into the state of your affections  he might be alluding to mr  martin   he might have mr  martin  interest in view   but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit    mr  martin!  no indeed!  there was not a hint of mr  martin  i hope i know better now  than to care for mr  martin  or to be suspected of it    when harriet had closed her evidence  she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse  to say whether she had not good ground for hope    i never should have presumed to think of it at first   said she   but for you   you told me to observe him carefully  and let his behaviour be the rule of mine  and so i have   but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him  and that if he does chuse me  it will not be any thing so very wonderful    the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech  the many bitter feelings  made the utmost exertion necessary on emma  side  to enable her to say on reply    harriet  i will only venture to declare  that mr  knightley is the last man in the world  who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does    harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory  and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness  which at that moment would have been dreadful penance  by the sound of her father  footsteps   he was coming through the hall   harriet was too much agitated to encounter him    she could not compose herself   mr  woodhouse would be alarmed  she had better go    with most ready encouragement from her friend  therefore  she passed off through another door  and the moment she was gone  this was the spontaneous burst of emma  feelings    oh god! that i had never seen her!   the rest of the day  the following night  were hardly enough for her thoughts   she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours  every moment had brought a fresh surprize  and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her   how to understand it all! how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself  and living under!  the blunders  the blindness of her own head and heart!  she sat still  she walked about  she tried her own room  she tried the shrubbery  in every place  every posture  she perceived that she had acted most weakly  that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree  that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying  that she was wretched  and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness   to understand  thoroughly understand her own heart  was the first endeavour   to that point went every leisure moment which her father  claims on her allowed  and every moment of involuntary absence of mind   how long had mr  knightley been so dear to her  as every feeling declared him now to be   when had his influence  such influence begun    when had he succeeded to that place in her affection  which frank churchill had once  for a short period  occupied   she looked back  she compared the two  compared them  as they had always stood in her estimation  from the time of the latter  becoming known to her   and as they must at any time have been compared by her  had it   oh! had it  by any blessed felicity  occurred to her  to institute the comparison   she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr  knightley as infinitely the superior  or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear   she saw  that in persuading herself  in fancying  in acting to the contrary  she had been entirely under a delusion  totally ignorant of her own heart  and  in short  that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all!  this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection  this was the knowledge of herself  on the first question of inquiry  which she reached  and without being long in reaching it    she was most sorrowfully indignant  ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her  her affection for mr  knightley    every other part of her mind was disgusting   with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body  feelings  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body  destiny   she was proved to have been universally mistaken  and she had not quite done nothing  for she had done mischief  she had brought evil on harriet  on herself  and she too much feared  on mr  knightley   were this most unequal of all connexions to take place  on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning  for his attachment  she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet    and even were this not the case  he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly   mr  knightley and harriet smith!  it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind   the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace  threadbare  stale in the comparison  exciting no surprize  presenting no disparity  affording nothing to be said or thought   mr  knightley and harriet smith!  such an elevation on her side!  such a debasement on his!  it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion  to foresee the smiles  the sneers  the merriment it would prompt at his expense  the mortification and disdain of his brother  the thousand inconveniences to himself   could it be   no  it was impossible  and yet it was far  very far  from impossible   was it a new circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers   was it new for one  perhaps too busy to seek  to be the prize of a girl who would seek him   was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal  inconsistent  incongruous  or for chance and circumstance  as second causes  to direct the human fate   oh! had she never brought harriet forward!  had she left her where she ought  and where he had told her she ought!  had she not  with a folly which no tongue could express  prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong   all would have been safe  none of this dreadful sequel would have been   how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr  knightley!  how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!   but harriet was less humble  had fewer scruples than formerly    her inferiority  whether of mind or situation  seemed little felt    she had seemed more sensible of mr  elton  being to stoop in marrying her  than she now seemed of mr  knightley     alas! was not that her own doing too   who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self consequence but herself   who but herself had taught her  that she was to elevate herself if possible  and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment    if harriet  from being humble  were grown vain  it was her doing too     chapter xii   till now that she was threatened with its loss  emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being  first  with mr  knightley  first in interest and affection   satisfied that it was so  and feeling it her due  she had enjoyed it without reflection  and only in the dread of being supplanted  found how inexpressibly important it had been   long  very long  she felt she had been first  for  having no female connexions of his own  there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers  and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella  she had herself been first with him for many years past  she had not deserved it  she had often been negligent or perverse  slighting his advice  or even wilfully opposing him  insensible of half his merits  and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own  but still  from family attachment and habit  and thorough excellence of mind  he had loved her  and watched over her from a girl  with an endeavour to improve her  and an anxiety for her doing right  which no other creature had at all shared   in spite of all her faults  she knew she was dear to him  might she not say  very dear    when the suggestions of hope  however  which must follow here  presented themselves  she could not presume to indulge them  harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly  exclusively  passionately loved by mr  knightley    she  could not  she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to  her    she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality    how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates!  how directly  how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!  not too strongly for the offence  but far  far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill    she had no hope  nothing to deserve the name of hope  that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question  but there was a hope  at times a slight one  at times much stronger   that harriet might have deceived herself  and be overrating his regard for  her    wish it she must  for his sake  be the consequence nothing to herself  but his remaining single all his life  could she be secure of that  indeed  of his never marrying at all  she believed she should be perfectly satisfied   let him but continue the same mr  knightley to her and her father  the same mr  knightley to all the world  let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence  and her peace would be fully secured   marriage  in fact  would not do for her  it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father  and with what she felt for him   nothing should separate her from her father  she would not marry  even if she were asked by mr  knightley   it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed  and she hoped  that when able to see them together again  she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were   she should see them henceforward with the closest observance  and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching  she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here    he was expected back every day   the power of observation would be soon given  frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course   in the meanwhile  she resolved against seeing harriet    it would do neither of them good  it would do the subject no good  to be talking of it farther   she was resolved not to be convinced  as long as she could doubt  and yet had no authority for opposing harriet  confidence   to talk would be only to irritate   she wrote to her  therefore  kindly  but decisively  to beg that she would not  at present  come to hartfield  acknowledging it to be her conviction  that all farther confidential discussion of  one  topic had better be avoided  and hoping  that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again  except in the company of others  she objected only to a tete a tete  they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday   harriet submitted  and approved  and was grateful   this point was just arranged  when a visitor arrived to tear emma  thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them  sleeping or waking  the last twenty four hours  mrs  weston  who had been calling on her daughter in law elect  and took hartfield in her way home  almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself  to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview   mr  weston had accompanied her to mrs  bates   and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely  but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing  was now returned with much more to say  and much more to say with satisfaction  than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs  bates  parlour  with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings  could have afforded   a little curiosity emma had  and she made the most of it while her friend related   mrs  weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself  and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present  to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead  and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed  and mr  churchill could be reconciled to the engagement  becoming known  as  considering every thing  she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports    but mr  weston had thought differently  he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family  and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it  or if it were  that it would be of any consequence  for  such things   he observed   always got about    emma smiled  and felt that mr  weston had very good reason for saying so   they had gone  in short  and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady  she had hardly been able to speak a word  and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness   the quiet  heart felt satisfaction of the old lady  and the rapturous delight of her daughter  who proved even too joyous to talk as usual  had been a gratifying  yet almost an affecting  scene   they were both so truly respectable in their happiness  so disinterested in every sensation  thought so much of jane  so much of every body  and so little of themselves  that every kindly feeling was at work for them   miss fairfax  recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs  weston to invite her to an airing  she had drawn back and declined at first  but  on being pressed had yielded  and  in the course of their drive  mrs  weston had  by gentle encouragement  overcome so much of her embarrassment  as to bring her to converse on the important subject   apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception  and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr  weston  must necessarily open the cause  but when these effusions were put by  they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement   mrs  weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion  pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been  and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject    on the misery of what she had suffered  during the concealment of so many months   continued mrs  weston   she was energetic  this was one of her expressions   `i will not say  that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments  but i can say  that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour '   and the quivering lip  emma  which uttered it  was an attestation that i felt at my heart     poor girl!  said emma    she thinks herself wrong  then  for having consented to a private engagement     wrong!  no one  i believe  can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself   `the consequence ' said she  `has been a state of perpetual suffering to me  and so it ought   but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring  it is still not less misconduct  pain is no expiation   i never can be blameless   i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right  and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken  and the kindness i am now receiving  is what my conscience tells me ought not to be '  `do not imagine  madam ' she continued  `that i was taught wrong   do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up   the error has been all my own  and i do assure you that  with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give  i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell '    poor girl!  said emma again    she loves him then excessively  i suppose   it must have been from attachment only  that she could be led to form the engagement   her affection must have overpowered her judgment     yes  i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him     i am afraid   returned emma  sighing   that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy     on your side  my love  it was very innocently done   but she probably had something of that in her thoughts  when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before  one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in   she said   was that of making her  unreasonable    the consciousness of having done amiss  had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes  and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been   that had been  hard for him to bear   `i did not make the allowances ' said she  `which i ought to have done  for his temper and spirits   his delightful spirits  and that gaiety  that playfulness of disposition  which  under any other circumstances  would  i am sure  have been as constantly bewitching to me  as they were at first ' she then began to speak of you  and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness  and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected  desired me  whenever i had an opportunity  to thank you  i could not thank you too much  for every wish and every endeavour to do her good   she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself     if i did not know her to be happy now   said emma  seriously   which  in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience  she must be  i could not bear these thanks   for  oh! mrs  weston  if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax!  well  checking herself  and trying to be more lively   this is all to be forgotten  you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars  they shew her to the greatest advantage   i am sure she is very good   i hope she will be very happy   it is fit that the fortune should be on his side  for i think the merit will be all on hers    such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs  weston  she thought well of frank in almost every respect  and  what was more  she loved him very much  and her defence was  therefore  earnest  she talked with a great deal of reason  and at least equal affection   but she had too much to urge for emma  attention  it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell  she forgot to attempt to listen  and when mrs  weston ended with   we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for  you know  but i hope it will soon come   she was obliged to pause before she answered  and at last obliged to answer at random  before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for    are you well  my emma   was mrs  weston  parting question    oh! perfectly   i am always well  you know   be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible    mrs  weston  communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection  by increasing her esteem and compassion  and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax   she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her  and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been  in some measure  the cause   had she followed mr  knightley  known wishes  in paying that attention to miss fairfax  which was every way her due  had she tried to know her better  had she done her part towards intimacy  had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith  she must  in all probability  have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now   birth  abilities  and education  had been equally marking one as an associate for her  to be received with gratitude  and the other  what was she   supposing even that they had never become intimate friends  that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax  confidence on this important matter   which was most probable  still  in knowing her as she ought  and as she might  she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr  dixon  which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself  but had so unpardonably imparted  an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane  feelings  by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill    of all the sources of evil surrounding the former  since her coming to highbury  she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst  she must have been a perpetual enemy   they never could have been all three together  without her having stabbed jane fairfax  peace in a thousand instances  and on box hill  perhaps  it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more   the evening of this day was very long  and melancholy  at hartfield  the weather added what it could of gloom   a cold stormy rain set in  and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs  which the wind was despoiling  and the length of the day  which only made such cruel sights the longer visible   the weather affected mr  woodhouse  and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter  side  and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before  it reminded her of their first forlorn tete a tete  on the evening of mrs  weston  wedding day  but mr  knightley had walked in then  soon after tea  and dissipated every melancholy fancy  alas! such delightful proofs of hartfield  attraction  as those sort of visits conveyed  might shortly be over   the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter  had proved erroneous  no friends had deserted them  no pleasures had been lost   but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction   the prospect before her now  was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled   that might not be even partially brightened   if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends  hartfield must be comparatively deserted  and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness   the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself  and mrs  weston  heart and time would be occupied by it   they should lose her  and  probably  in great measure  her husband also   frank churchill would return among them no more  and miss fairfax  it was reasonable to suppose  would soon cease to belong to highbury   they would be married  and settled either at or near enscombe   all that were good would be withdrawn  and if to these losses  the loss of donwell were to be added  what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach  mr  knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!   no longer walking in at all hours  as if ever willing to change his own home for their !  how was it to be endured   and if he were to be lost to them for harriet  sake  if he were to be thought of hereafter  as finding in harriet  society all that he wanted  if harriet were to be the chosen  the first  the dearest  the friend  the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence  what could be increasing emma  wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind  that it had been all her own work   when it came to such a pitch as this  she was not able to refrain from a start  or a heavy sigh  or even from walking about the room for a few seconds  and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn  was in the resolution of her own better conduct  and the hope that  however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past  it would yet find her more rational  more acquainted with herself  and leave her less to regret when it were gone     chapter xiii   the weather continued much the same all the following morning  and the same loneliness  and the same melancholy  seemed to reign at hartfield  but in the afternoon it cleared  the wind changed into a softer quarter  the clouds were carried off  the sun appeared  it was summer again   with all the eagerness which such a transition gives  emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible   never had the exquisite sight  smell  sensation of nature  tranquil  warm  and brilliant after a storm  been more attractive to her   she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce  and on mr  perry  coming in soon after dinner  with a disengaged hour to give her father  she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery   there  with spirits freshened  and thoughts a little relieved  she had taken a few turns  when she saw mr  knightley passing through the garden door  and coming towards her   it was the first intimation of his being returned from london   she had been thinking of him the moment before  as unquestionably sixteen miles distant   there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind   she must be collected and calm  in half a minute they were together   the  how d'ye do   were quiet and constrained on each side   she asked after their mutual friends  they were all well   when had he left them   only that morning  he must have had a wet ride   yes   he meant to walk with her  she found    he had just looked into the dining room  and as he was not wanted there  preferred being out of doors    she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully  and the first possible cause for it  suggested by her fears  was  that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother  and was pained by the manner in which they had been received   they walked together   he was silent   she thought he was often looking at her  and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give   and this belief produced another dread  perhaps he wanted to speak to her  of his attachment to harriet  he might be watching for encouragement to begin   she did not  could not  feel equal to lead the way to any such subject  he must do it all himself   yet she could not bear this silence  with him it was most unnatural   she considered  resolved  and  trying to smile  began     you have some news to hear  now you are come back  that will rather surprize you     have i   said he quietly  and looking at her   of what nature     oh! the best nature in the world  a wedding    after waiting a moment  as if to be sure she intended to say no more  he replied    if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill  i have heard that already     how is it possible   cried emma  turning her glowing cheeks towards him  for  while she spoke  it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs  goddard  in his way    i had a few lines on parish business from mr  weston this morning  and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened    emma was quite relieved  and could presently say  with a little more composure     you  probably have been less surprized than any of us  for you have had your suspicions   i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution   i wish i had attended to it  but   with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh  i seem to have been doomed to blindness    for a moment or two nothing was said  and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest  till she found her arm drawn within his  and pressed against his heart  and heard him thus saying  in a tone of great sensibility  speaking low    time  my dearest emma  time will heal the wound   your own excellent sense  your exertions for your father  sake  i know you will not allow yourself      her arm was pressed again  as he added  in a more broken and subdued accent   the feelings of the warmest friendship  indignation  abominable scoundrel!    and in a louder  steadier tone  he concluded with   he will soon be gone   they will soon be in yorkshire   i am sorry for  her   she deserves a better fate    emma understood him  and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure  excited by such tender consideration  replied    you are very kind  but you are mistaken  and i must set you right    i am not in want of that sort of compassion   my blindness to what was going on  led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of  and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures  but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier     emma!  cried he  looking eagerly at her   are you  indeed     but checking himself   no  no  i understand you  forgive me  i am pleased that you can say even so much   he is no object of regret  indeed! and it will not be very long  i hope  before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason   fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!  i could never  i confess  from your manners  assure myself as to the degree of what you felt   i could only be certain that there was a preference  and a preference which i never believed him to deserve   he is a disgrace to the name of man   and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman    jane  jane  you will be a miserable creature     mr  knightley   said emma  trying to be lively  but really confused    i am in a very extraordinary situation   i cannot let you continue in your error  and yet  perhaps  since my manners gave such an impression  i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of  as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse    but i never have    he listened in perfect silence   she wished him to speak  but he would not   she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion   she went on  however    i have very little to say for my own conduct   i was tempted by his attentions  and allowed myself to appear pleased    an old story  probably  a common case  and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before  and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding   many circumstances assisted the temptation   he was the son of mr  weston  he was continually here  i always found him very pleasant  and  in short  for  with a sigh  let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously  they all centre in this at last  my vanity was flattered  and i allowed his attentions   latterly  however  for some time  indeed   i have had no idea of their meaning any thing   i thought them a habit  a trick  nothing that called for seriousness on my side  he has imposed on me  but he has not injured me   i have never been attached to him   and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour  he never wished to attach me   it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another   it was his object to blind all about him  and no one  i am sure  could be more effectually blinded than myself  except that i was  not  blinded  that it was my good fortune  that  in short  i was somehow or other safe from him    she had hoped for an answer here  for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible  but he was silent  and  as far as she could judge  deep in thought   at last  and tolerably in his usual tone  he said    i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill   i can suppose  however  that i may have underrated him   my acquaintance with him has been but trifling   and even if i have not underrated him hitherto  he may yet turn out well   with such a woman he has a chance   i have no motive for wishing him ill  and for her sake  whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct  i shall certainly wish him well     i have no doubt of their being happy together   said emma   i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached     he is a most fortunate man!  returned mr  knightley  with energy   so early in life  at three and twenty  a period when  if a man chuses a wife  he generally chuses ill   at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize!  what years of felicity that man  in all human calculation  has before him!  assured of the love of such a woman  the disinterested love  for jane fairfax  character vouches for her disinterestedness  every thing in his favour    equality of situation  i mean  as far as regards society  and all the habits and manners that are important  equality in every point but one   and that one  since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted  such as must increase his felicity  for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants   a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from  and he who can do it  where there is no doubt of  her  regard  must  i think  be the happiest of mortals   frank churchill is  indeed  the favourite of fortune  every thing turns out for his good   he meets with a young woman at a watering place  gains her affection  cannot even weary her by negligent treatment  and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him  they could not have found her superior   his aunt is in the way   his aunt dies   he has only to speak   his friends are eager to promote his happiness    he had used every body ill  and they are all delighted to forgive him    he is a fortunate man indeed!    you speak as if you envied him     and i do envy him  emma   in one respect he is the object of my envy    emma could say no more   they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet  and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject  if possible   she made her plan  she would speak of something totally different  the children in brunswick square  and she only waited for breath to begin  when mr  knightley startled her  by saying    you will not ask me what is the point of envy   you are determined  i see  to have no curiosity   you are wise  but  i  cannot be wise  emma  i must tell you what you will not ask  though i may wish it unsaid the next moment     oh! then  don't speak it  don't speak it   she eagerly cried   take a little time  consider  do not commit yourself     thank you   said he  in an accent of deep mortification  and not another syllable followed   emma could not bear to give him pain   he was wishing to confide in her   perhaps to consult her   cost her what it would  she would listen  she might assist his resolution  or reconcile him to it  she might give just praise to harriet  or  by representing to him his own independence  relieve him from that state of indecision  which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his   they had reached the house    you are going in  i suppose   said he    no    replied emma  quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke   i should like to take another turn  mr  perry is not gone    and  after proceeding a few steps  she added    i stopped you ungraciously  just now  mr  knightley  and  i am afraid  gave you pain   but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend  or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation  as a friend  indeed  you may command me   i will hear whatever you like   i will tell you exactly what i think     as a friend!   repeated mr  knightley    emma  that i fear is a word  no  i have no wish  stay  yes  why should i hesitate    i have gone too far already for concealment   emma  i accept your offer   extraordinary as it may seem  i accept it  and refer myself to you as a friend   tell me  then  have i no chance of ever succeeding    he stopped in his earnestness to look the question  and the expression of his eyes overpowered her    my dearest emma   said he   for dearest you will always be  whatever the event of this hour  conversation  my dearest  most beloved emma  tell me at once   say `no ' if it is to be said     she could really say nothing    you are silent   he cried  with great animation   absolutely silent! at present i ask no more    emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment  the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream  was perhaps the most prominent feeling    i cannot make speeches  emma    he soon resumed  and in a tone of such sincere  decided  intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing    if i loved you less  i might be able to talk about it more   but you know what i am   you hear nothing but truth from me   i have blamed you  and lectured you  and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it    bear with the truths i would tell you now  dearest emma  as well as you have borne with them   the manner  perhaps  may have as little to recommend them   god knows  i have been a very indifferent lover    but you understand me   yes  you see  you understand my feelings   and will return them if you can   at present  i ask only to hear  once to hear your voice    while he spoke  emma  mind was most busy  and  with all the wonderful velocity of thought  had been able  and yet without losing a word   to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole  to see that harriet  hopes had been entirely groundless  a mistake  a delusion  as complete a delusion as any of her own  that harriet was nothing  that she was every thing herself  that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings  and that her agitation  her doubts  her reluctance  her discouragement  had been all received as discouragement from herself   and not only was there time for these convictions  with all their glow of attendant happiness  there was time also to rejoice that harriet  secret had not escaped her  and to resolve that it need not  and should not   it was all the service she could now render her poor friend  for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet  as infinitely the most worthy of the two   or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever  without vouchsafing any motive  because he could not marry them both  emma had it not   she felt for harriet  with pain and with contrition  but no flight of generosity run mad  opposing all that could be probable or reasonable  entered her brain  she had led her friend astray  and it would be a reproach to her for ever  but her judgment was as strong as her feelings  and as strong as it had ever been before  in reprobating any such alliance for him  as most unequal and degrading   her way was clear  though not quite smooth   she spoke then  on being so entreated    what did she say   just what she ought  of course   a lady always does    she said enough to shew there need not be despair  and to invite him to say more himself   he  had  despaired at one period  he had received such an injunction to caution and silence  as for the time crushed every hope   she had begun by refusing to hear him   the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden   her proposal of taking another turn  her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to  might be a little extraordinary!  she felt its inconsistency  but mr  knightley was so obliging as to put up with it  and seek no farther explanation   seldom  very seldom  does complete truth belong to any human disclosure  seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised  or a little mistaken  but where  as in this case  though the conduct is mistaken  the feelings are not  it may not be very material    mr  knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed  or a heart more disposed to accept of his   he had  in fact  been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence  he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it  he had come  in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill  engagement  with no selfish view  no view at all  but of endeavouring  if she allowed him an opening  to soothe or to counsel her   the rest had been the work of the moment  the immediate effect of what he heard  on his feelings   the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill  of her having a heart completely disengaged from him  had given birth to the hope  that  in time  he might gain her affection himself   but it had been no present hope  he had only  in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment  aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her   the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting    the affection  which he had been asking to be allowed to create  if he could  was already his!  within half an hour  he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind  to something so like perfect happiness  that it could bear no other name    her  change was equal   this one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved  had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance  jealousy  or distrust   on his side  there had been a long standing jealousy  old as the arrival  or even the expectation  of frank churchill   he had been in love with emma  and jealous of frank churchill  from about the same period  one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other  it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country   the box hill party had decided him on going away  he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted  encouraged attentions   he had gone to learn to be indifferent    but he had gone to a wrong place   there was too much domestic happiness in his brother  house  woman wore too amiable a form in it  isabella was too much like emma  differing only in those striking inferiorities  which always brought the other in brilliancy before him  for much to have been done  even had his time been longer   he had stayed on  however  vigorously  day after day  till this very morning  post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax   then  with the gladness which must be felt  nay  which he did not scruple to feel  having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma  was there so much fond solicitude  so much keen anxiety for her  that he could stay no longer   he had ridden home through the rain  and had walked up directly after dinner  to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures  faultless in spite of all her faults  bore the discovery   he had found her agitated and low   frank churchill was a villain    he heard her declare that she had never loved him   frank churchill  character was not desperate   she was his own emma  by hand and word  when they returned into the house  and if he could have thought of frank churchill then  he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow     chapter xiv   what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out!  she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering   she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness  and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away   they sat down to tea  the same party round the same table   how often it had been collected!  and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn  and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!  but never in such a state of spirits  never in any thing like it  and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house  or even the attentive daughter   poor mr  woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming  and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride   could he have seen the heart  he would have cared very little for the lungs  but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil  without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either  he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr  perry  and talked on with much self contentment  totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return   as long as mr  knightley remained with them  emma  fever continued  but when he was gone  she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued  and in the course of the sleepless night  which was the tax for such an evening  she found one or two such very serious points to consider  as made her feel  that even her happiness must have some alloy   her father  and harriet   she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims  and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost  was the question  with respect to her father  it was a question soon answered  she hardly knew yet what mr  knightley would ask  but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father   she even wept over the idea of it  as a sin of thought   while he lived  it must be only an engagement  but she flattered herself  that if divested of the danger of drawing her away  it might become an increase of comfort to him    how to do her best by harriet  was of more difficult decision    how to spare her from any unnecessary pain  how to make her any possible atonement  how to appear least her enemy    on these subjects  her perplexity and distress were very great   and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it    she could only resolve at last  that she would still avoid a meeting with her  and communicate all that need be told by letter  that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury  and  indulging in one scheme more   nearly resolve  that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square   isabella had been pleased with harriet  and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement    she did not think it in harriet  nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety  by the streets  the shops  and the children    at any rate  it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself  from whom every thing was due  a separation for the present  an averting of the evil day  when they must all be together again   she rose early  and wrote her letter to harriet  an employment which left her so very serious  so nearly sad  that mr  knightley  in walking up to hartfield to breakfast  did not arrive at all too soon  and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him  literally and figuratively  was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before   he had not left her long  by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else  when a letter was brought her from randalls  a very thick letter   she guessed what it must contain  and deprecated the necessity of reading it    she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill  she wanted no explanations  she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself   and as for understanding any thing he wrote  she was sure she was incapable of it   it must be waded through  however   she opened the packet  it was too surely so   a note from mrs  weston to herself  ushered in the letter from frank to mrs  weston    i have the greatest pleasure  my dear emma  in forwarding to you the enclosed   i know what thorough justice you will do it  and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect   i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again  but i will not delay you by a long preface   we are quite well    this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately   i did not quite like your looks on tuesday  but it was an ungenial morning  and though you will never own being affected by weather  i think every body feels a north east wind    i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning  but had the comfort of hearing last night  by mr  perry  that it had not made him ill                                 yours ever                                                          a  w                            to mrs  weston                                                          windsor july  my dear madam    if i made myself intelligible yesterday  this letter will be expected  but expected or not  i know it will be read with candour and indulgence    you are all goodness  and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct    but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent  my courage rises while i write   it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble   i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon  that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours  and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence   you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls  you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards   this was the fact   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment  is another question  i shall not discuss it here   for my temptation to  think  it a right  i refer every caviller to a brick house  sashed windows below  and casements above  in highbury   i dared not address her openly  my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition  and i was fortunate enough to prevail  before we parted at weymouth  and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement    had she refused  i should have gone mad   but you will be ready to say  what was your hope in doing this   what did you look forward to    to any thing  every thing  to time  chance  circumstance  slow effects  sudden bursts  perseverance and weariness  health and sickness  every possibility of good was before me  and the first of blessings secured  in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence  if you need farther explanation  i have the honour  my dear madam  of being your husband  son  and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good  which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of   see me  then  under these circumstances  arriving on my first visit to randalls   and here i am conscious of wrong  for that visit might have been sooner paid  you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury  and as  you  were the person slighted  you will forgive me instantly  but i must work on my father  compassion  by reminding him  that so long as i absented myself from his house  so long i lost the blessing of knowing you   my behaviour  during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you  did not  i hope  lay me open to reprehension  excepting on one point  and now i come to the principal  the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you  which excites my own anxiety  or requires very solicitous explanation   with the greatest respect  and the warmest friendship  do i mention miss woodhouse  my father perhaps will think i ought to add  with the deepest humiliation    a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion  and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to   my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated  i believe  more than it ought    in order to assist a concealment so essential to me  i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown   i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object  but i am sure you will believe the declaration  that had i not been convinced of her indifference  i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on    amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is  she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached  and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me  was as much my conviction as my wish   she received my attentions with an easy  friendly  goodhumoured playfulness  which exactly suited me  we seemed to understand each other   from our relative situation  those attentions were her due  and were felt to be so   whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight  i cannot say   when i called to take leave of her  i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth  and i then fancied she was not without suspicion  but i have no doubt of her having since detected me  at least in some degree    she may not have surmised the whole  but her quickness must have penetrated a part   i cannot doubt it   you will find  whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints  that it did not take her wholly by surprize   she frequently gave me hints of it   i remember her telling me at the ball  that i owed mrs  elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax    i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss  while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse  i could deserve nothing from either   acquit me here  and procure for me  when it is allowable  the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse  whom i regard with so much brotherly affection  as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself    whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight  you have now a key to   my heart was in highbury  and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be  and with the least suspicion  if you remember any queernesses  set them all to the right account    of the pianoforte so much talked of  i feel it only necessary to say  that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f    who would never have allowed me to send it  had any choice been given her    the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement  my dear madam  is much beyond my power of doing justice to  you will soon  i earnestly hope  know her thoroughly yourself    no description can describe her   she must tell you herself what she is   yet not by word  for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit   since i began this letter  which will be longer than i foresaw  i have heard from her    she gives a good account of her own health  but as she never complains  i dare not depend   i want to have your opinion of her looks  i know you will soon call on her  she is living in dread of the visit  perhaps it is paid already   let me hear from you without delay  i am impatient for a thousand particulars   remember how few minutes i was at randalls  and in how bewildered  how mad a state  and i am not much better yet  still insane either from happiness or misery   when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with  of her excellence and patience  and my uncle  generosity  i am mad with joy   but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her  and how little i deserve to be forgiven  i am mad with anger  if i could but see her again!  but i must not propose it yet  my uncle has been too good for me to encroach   i must still add to this long letter   you have not heard all that you ought to hear  i could not give any connected detail yesterday  but the suddenness  and  in one light  the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out  needs explanation  for though the event of the 26th ult   as you will conclude  immediately opened to me the happiest prospects  i should not have presumed on such early measures  but from the very particular circumstances  which left me not an hour to lose  i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty  and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement    but i had no choice   the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman  here  my dear madam  i was obliged to leave off abruptly  to recollect and compose myself   i have been walking over the country  and am now  i hope  rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be   it is  in fact  a most mortifying retrospect for me   i behaved shamefully   and here i can admit  that my manners to miss w   in being unpleasant to miss f   were highly blameable   she  disapproved them  which ought to have been enough   my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient   she was displeased  i thought unreasonably so   i thought her  on a thousand occasions  unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious   i thought her even cold  but she was always right   if i had followed her judgment  and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper  i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known   we quarrelled    do you remember the morning spent at donwell    there  every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis   i was late  i met her walking home by herself  and wanted to walk with her  but she would not suffer it   she absolutely refused to allow me  which i then thought most unreasonable   now  however  i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion  while i  to blind the world to our engagement  was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman  was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless   had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury  the truth must have been suspected    i was mad enough  however  to resent   i doubted her affection  i doubted it more the next day on box hill  when  provoked by such conduct on my side  such shameful  insolent neglect of her  and such apparent devotion to miss w   as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure  she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me    in short  my dear madam  it was a quarrel blameless on her side  abominable on mine  and i returned the same evening to richmond  though i might have staid with you till the next morning  merely because i would be as angry with her as possible   even then  i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time  but i was the injured person  injured by her coldness  and i went away determined that she should make the first advances   i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party  had you witnessed my behaviour there  i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again   its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced   as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls  she closed with the offer of that officious mrs  elton  the whole system of whose treatment of her  by the bye  has ever filled me with indignation and hatred  i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself  but  otherwise  i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known    `jane ' indeed!  you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name  even to you   think  then  what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition  and all the insolence of imaginary superiority   have patience with me  i shall soon have done    she closed with this offer  resolving to break with me entirely  and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again     she   felt   the   engagement   to   be   a   source   of   repentance   and   misery   to   each     she   dissolved   it    this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt  death   i answered it within an hour  but from the confusion of my mind  and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once  my answer  instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day  was locked up in my writing desk  and i  trusting that i had written enough  though but a few lines  to satisfy her  remained without any uneasiness   i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily  but i made excuses for her  and was too busy  and  may i add    too cheerful in my views to be captious   we removed to windsor  and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her  my own letters all returned!  and a few lines at the same time by the post  stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last  and adding  that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued  and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible  she now sent me  by a safe conveyance  all my letters  and requested  that if i could not directly command hers  so as to send them to highbury within a week  i would forward them after that period to her at     in short  the full direction to mr  smallridge   near bristol  stared me in the face   i knew the name  the place  i knew all about it  and instantly saw what she had been doing  it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess  and the secrecy she had maintained  as to any such design in her former letter  was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy   for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me   imagine the shock  imagine how  till i had actually detected my own blunder  i raved at the blunders of the post    what was to be done   one thing only   i must speak to my uncle  without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again    i spoke  circumstances were in my favour  the late event had softened away his pride  and he was  earlier than i could have anticipated  wholly reconciled and complying  and could say at last  poor man! with a deep sigh  that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done   i felt that it would be of a different sort   are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him  for my suspense while all was at stake   no  do not pity me till i reached highbury  and saw how ill i had made her   do not pity me till i saw her wan  sick looks   i reached highbury at the time of day when  from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour  i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone   i was not disappointed  and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey   a great deal of very reasonable  very just displeasure i had to persuade away  but it is done  we are reconciled  dearer  much dearer  than ever  and no moment  uneasiness can ever occur between us again   now  my dear madam  i will release you  but i could not conclude before  a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me  and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her   if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve  i am quite of your opinion   miss w  calls me the child of good fortune   i hope she is right   in one respect  my good fortune is undoubted  that of being able to subscribe myself                      your obliged and affectionate son                                            f  c  weston churchill     chapter xv   this letter must make its way to emma  feelings   she was obliged  in spite of her previous determination to the contrary  to do it all the justice that mrs  weston foretold   as soon as she came to her own name  it was irresistible  every line relating to herself was interesting  and almost every line agreeable  and when this charm ceased  the subject could still maintain itself  by the natural return of her former regard for the writer  and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment   she never stopt till she had gone through the whole  and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong  yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed  and he had suffered  and was very sorry  and he was so grateful to mrs  weston  and so much in love with miss fairfax  and she was so happy herself  that there was no being severe  and could he have entered the room  she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever   she thought so well of the letter  that when mr  knightley came again  she desired him to read it   she was sure of mrs  weston  wishing it to be communicated  especially to one  who  like mr  knightley  had seen so much to blame in his conduct    i shall be very glad to look it over   said he   but it seems long  i will take it home with me at night    but that would not do   mr  weston was to call in the evening  and she must return it by him    i would rather be talking to you   he replied   but as it seems a matter of justice  it shall be done    he began  stopping  however  almost directly to say   had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman  letters to his mother in law a few months ago  emma  it would not have been taken with such indifference    he proceeded a little farther  reading to himself  and then  with a smile  observed   humph! a fine complimentary opening  but it is his way   one man  style must not be the rule of another   we will not be severe     it will be natural for me   he added shortly afterwards   to speak my opinion aloud as i read   by doing it  i shall feel that i am near you  it will not be so great a loss of time   but if you dislike it      not at all   i should wish it    mr  knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity    he trifles here   said he   as to the temptation   he knows he is wrong  and has nothing rational to urge   bad   he ought not to have formed the engagement   `his father  disposition '   he is unjust  however  to his father   mr  weston  sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions  but mr  weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it   very true  he did not come till miss fairfax was here     and i have not forgotten   said emma   how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would   you pass it over very handsomely   but you were perfectly right     i was not quite impartial in my judgment  emma   but yet  i think   had  you  not been in the case  i should still have distrusted him    when he came to miss woodhouse  he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud  all that related to her  with a smile  a look  a shake of the head  a word or two of assent  or disapprobation  or merely of love  as the subject required  concluding  however  seriously  and  after steady reflection  thus     very bad  though it might have been worse   playing a most dangerous game   too much indebted to the event for his acquittal    no judge of his own manners by you   always deceived in fact by his own wishes  and regardless of little besides his own convenience    fancying you to have fathomed his secret   natural enough!   his own mind full of intrigue  that he should suspect it in others   mystery  finesse  how they pervert the understanding! my emma  does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other    emma agreed to it  and with a blush of sensibility on harriet  account  which she could not give any sincere explanation of    you had better go on   said she   he did so  but very soon stopt again to say   the pianoforte! ah!  that was the act of a very  very young man  one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure   a boyish scheme  indeed!  i cannot comprehend a man  wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with  and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument  coming if she could    after this  he made some progress without any pause  frank churchill  confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing    i perfectly agree with you  sir    was then his remark   you did behave very shamefully   you never wrote a truer line   and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement  and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax  sense of right  he made a fuller pause to say   this is very bad   he had induced her to place herself  for his sake  in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness  and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily   she must have had much more to contend with  in carrying on the correspondence  than he could   he should have respected even unreasonable scruples  had there been such  but hers were all reasonable   we must look to her one fault  and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement  to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment    emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party  and grew uncomfortable   her own behaviour had been so very improper! she was deeply ashamed  and a little afraid of his next look  it was all read  however  steadily  attentively  and without the smallest remark  and  excepting one momentary glance at her  instantly withdrawn  in the fear of giving pain  no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist    there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends  the eltons   was his next observation    his feelings are natural    what! actually resolve to break with him entirely!  she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each   she dissolved it   what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!  well  he must be a most extraordinary      nay  nay  read on   you will find how very much he suffers     i hope he does   replied mr  knightley coolly  and resuming the letter   `smallridge!'  what does this mean   what is all this     she had engaged to go as governess to mrs  smallridge  children   a dear friend of mrs  elton   a neighbour of maple grove  and  by the bye  i wonder how mrs  elton bears the disappointment     say nothing  my dear emma  while you oblige me to read  not even of mrs  elton   only one page more   i shall soon have done  what a letter the man writes!    i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him     well  there  is  feeling here   he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill   certainly  i can have no doubt of his being fond of her  `dearer  much dearer than ever '  i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation   he is a very liberal thanker  with his thousands and tens of thousands   `happier than i deserve ' come  he knows himself there   `miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune '  those were miss woodhouse  words  were they    and a fine ending  and there is the letter   the child of good fortune! that was your name for him  was it     you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am  but still you must  at least i hope you must  think the better of him for it   i hope it does him some service with you     yes  certainly it does   he has had great faults  faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness  and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves  but still as he is  beyond a doubt  really attached to miss fairfax  and will soon  it may be hoped  have the advantage of being constantly with her  i am very ready to believe his character will improve  and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants   and now  let me talk to you of something else  i have another person  interest at present so much at heart  that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill   ever since i left you this morning  emma  my mind has been hard at work on one subject    the subject followed  it was in plain  unaffected  gentlemanlike english  such as mr  knightley used even to the woman he was in love with  how to be able to ask her to marry him  without attacking the happiness of her father   emma  answer was ready at the first word   while her dear father lived  any change of condition must be impossible for her   she could never quit him    part only of this answer  however  was admitted   the impossibility of her quitting her father  mr  knightley felt as strongly as herself  but the inadmissibility of any other change  he could not agree to   he had been thinking it over most deeply  most intently  he had at first hoped to induce mr  woodhouse to remove with her to donwell  he had wanted to believe it feasible  but his knowledge of mr  woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long  and now he confessed his persuasion  that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father  comfort  perhaps even of his life  which must not be hazarded   mr  woodhouse taken from hartfield!  no  he felt that it ought not to be attempted  but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this  he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable  it was  that he should be received at hartfield  that so long as her father  happiness in other words his life  required hartfield to continue her home  it should be his likewise   of their all removing to donwell  emma had already had her own passing thoughts   like him  she had tried the scheme and rejected it  but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her  she was sensible of all the affection it evinced   she felt that  in quitting donwell  he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits  that in living constantly with her father  and in no house of his own  there would be much  very much  to be borne with   she promised to think of it  and advised him to think of it more  but he was fully convinced  that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject   he had given it  he could assure her  very long and calm consideration  he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning  to have his thoughts to himself    ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for   cried emma    i am sure william larkins will not like it   you must get his consent before you ask mine    she promised  however  to think of it  and pretty nearly promised  moreover  to think of it  with the intention of finding it a very good scheme   it is remarkable  that emma  in the many  very many  points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey  was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry  whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded  think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy  and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it  and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr  knightley  marrying jane fairfax  or any body else  which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt   this proposal of his  this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield   the more she contemplated it  the more pleasing it became  his evils seemed to lessen  her own advantages to increase  their mutual good to outweigh every drawback   such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!   such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!  she would have been too happy but for poor harriet  but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend  who must now be even excluded from hartfield  the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself  poor harriet must  in mere charitable caution  be kept at a distance from   she would be a loser in every way   emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment  in such a party  harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise  but for the poor girl herself  it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment   in time  of course  mr  knightley would be forgotten  that is  supplanted  but this could not be expected to happen very early  mr  knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure    not like mr  elton   mr  knightley  always so kind  so feeling  so truly considerate for every body  would never deserve to be less worshipped than now  and it really was too much to hope even of harriet  that she could be in love with more than  three  men in one year     chapter xvi   it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting   their intercourse was painful enough by letter   how much worse  had they been obliged to meet!  harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed  without reproaches  or apparent sense of ill usage  and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment  a something bordering on it in her style  which increased the desirableness of their being separate    it might be only her own consciousness  but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke   she had no difficulty in procuring isabella  invitation  and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it  without resorting to invention   there was a tooth amiss  harriet really wished  and had wished some time  to consult a dentist  mrs  john knightley was delighted to be of use  any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her  and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr  wingfield  she was quite eager to have harriet under her care   when it was thus settled on her sister  side  emma proposed it to her friend  and found her very persuadable    harriet was to go  she was invited for at least a fortnight  she was to be conveyed in mr  woodhouse  carriage   it was all arranged  it was all completed  and harriet was safe in brunswick square   now emma could  indeed  enjoy mr  knightley  visits  now she could talk  and she could listen with true happiness  unchecked by that sense of injustice  of guilt  of something most painful  which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her  how much might at that moment  and at a little distance  be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself   the difference of harriet at mrs  goddard   or in london  made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma  sensations  but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment  which must be averting the past  and carrying her out of herself   she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied   there was a communication before her  one which  she  only could be competent to make   the confession of her engagement to her father  but she would have nothing to do with it at present   she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs  weston were safe and well   no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved   and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time   a fortnight  at least  of leisure and peace of mind  to crown every warmer  but more agitating  delight  should be hers   she soon resolved  equally as a duty and a pleasure  to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax    she ought to go  and she was longing to see her  the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill  it would be a  secret  satisfaction  but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate   she went  she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door  but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill  when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion  though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected    the fear of being still unwelcome  determined her  though assured of their being at home  to wait in the passage  and send up her name    she heard patty announcing it  but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible   no  she heard nothing but the instant reply of   beg her to walk up    and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself  coming eagerly forward  as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient    emma had never seen her look so well  so lovely  so engaging  there was consciousness  animation  and warmth  there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted    she came forward with an offered hand  and said  in a low  but very feeling tone    this is most kind  indeed!  miss woodhouse  it is impossible for me to express  i hope you will believe  excuse me for being so entirely without words    emma was gratified  and would soon have shewn no want of words  if the sound of mrs  elton  voice from the sitting room had not checked her  and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very  very earnest shake of the hand   mrs  bates and mrs  elton were together   miss bates was out  which accounted for the previous tranquillity   emma could have wished mrs  elton elsewhere  but she was in a humour to have patience with every body  and as mrs  elton met her with unusual graciousness  she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm   she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs  elton  thoughts  and understand why she was  like herself  in happy spirits  it was being in miss fairfax  confidence  and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people  emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face  and while paying her own compliments to mrs  bates  and appearing to attend to the good old lady  replies  she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax  and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side  saying  with significant nods    we can finish this some other time  you know   you and i shall not want opportunities   and  in fact  you have heard all the essential already   i only wanted to prove to you that mrs  s  admits our apology  and is not offended   you see how delightfully she writes   oh! she is a sweet creature!  you would have doated on her  had you gone   but not a word more   let us be discreet   quite on our good behaviour   hush!  you remember those lines   i forget the poem at this moment            for when a lady  in the case           you know all other things give place    now i say  my dear  in  our  case  for  lady   read    mum! a word to the wise   i am in a fine flow of spirits  an't i   but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs  s    my  representation  you see  has quite appeased her    and again  on emma  merely turning her head to look at mrs  bates  knitting  she added  in a half whisper    i mentioned no  names   you will observe   oh! no  cautious as a minister of state   i managed it extremely well    emma could not doubt   it was a palpable display  repeated on every possible occasion   when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs  weston  she found herself abruptly addressed with    do not you think  miss woodhouse  our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered   do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit    here was a side glance of great meaning at jane   upon my word  perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!   oh! if you had seen her  as i did  when she was at the worst!    and when mrs  bates was saying something to emma  whispered farther   we do not say a word of any  assistance  that perry might have  not a word of a certain young physician from windsor   oh! no  perry shall have all the credit     i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you  miss woodhouse   she shortly afterwards began   since the party to box hill  very pleasant party   but yet i think there was something wanting  things did not seem  that is  there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some   so it appeared to me at least  but i might be mistaken   however  i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again   what say you both to our collecting the same party  and exploring to box hill again  while the fine weather lasts    it must be the same party  you know  quite the same party  not  one  exception    soon after this miss bates came in  and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself  resulting  she supposed  from doubt of what might be said  and impatience to say every thing    thank you  dear miss woodhouse  you are all kindness   it is impossible to say  yes  indeed  i quite understand  dearest jane  prospects   that is  i do not mean   but she is charmingly recovered    how is mr  woodhouse   i am so glad   quite out of my power    such a happy little circle as you find us here   yes  indeed    charming young man!  that is  so very friendly  i mean good mr  perry!   such attention to jane!   and from her great  her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs  elton for being there  emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane  from the vicarage quarter  which was now graciously overcome    after a few whispers  indeed  which placed it beyond a guess  mrs  elton  speaking louder  said    yes  here i am  my good friend  and here i have been so long  that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise  but  the truth is  that i am waiting for my lord and master  he promised to join me here  and pay his respects to you     what! are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr  elton    that will be a favour indeed! for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits  and mr  elton  time is so engaged     upon my word it is  miss bates   he really is engaged from morning to night   there is no end of people  coming to him  on some pretence or other   the magistrates  and overseers  and churchwardens  are always wanting his opinion   they seem not able to do any thing without him   `upon my word  mr  e  ' i often say  `rather you than i    i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument  if i had half so many applicants '  bad enough as it is  for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree   i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight   however  he is coming  i assure you   yes  indeed  on purpose to wait on you all    and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma   a congratulatory visit  you know   oh! yes  quite indispensable    miss bates looked about her  so happily!     he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley  but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation   mr  e  is knightley  right hand    emma would not have smiled for the world  and only said   is mr  elton gone on foot to donwell   he will have a hot walk     oh! no  it is a meeting at the crown  a regular meeting  weston and cole will be there too  but one is apt to speak only of those who lead   i fancy mr  e  and knightley have every thing their own way     have not you mistaken the day   said emma    i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow   mr  knightley was at hartfield yesterday  and spoke of it as for saturday     oh! no  the meeting is certainly to day   was the abrupt answer  which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs  elton  side     i do believe   she continued   this is the most troublesome parish that ever was   we never heard of such things at maple grove     your parish there was small   said jane    upon my word  my dear  i do not know  for i never heard the subject talked of     but it is proved by the smallness of the school  which i have heard you speak of  as under the patronage of your sister and mrs  bragge  the only school  and not more than five and twenty children     ah! you clever creature  that  very true   what a thinking brain you have!  i say  jane  what a perfect character you and i should make  if we could be shaken together   my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection   not that i presume to insinuate  however  that  some  people may not think  you  perfection already   but hush!   not a word  if you please    it seemed an unnecessary caution  jane was wanting to give her words  not to mrs  elton  but to miss woodhouse  as the latter plainly saw  the wish of distinguishing her  as far as civility permitted  was very evident  though it could not often proceed beyond a look   mr  elton made his appearance   his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity    very pretty  sir  upon my word  to send me on here  to be an encumbrance to my friends  so long before you vouchsafe to come!   but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with  you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared    here have i been sitting this hour  giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience  for who can say  you know  how soon it may be wanted    mr  elton was so hot and tired  that all this wit seemed thrown away  his civilities to the other ladies must be paid  but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering  and the walk he had had for nothing    when i got to donwell   said he   knightley could not be found  very odd! very unaccountable! after the note i sent him this morning  and the message he returned  that he should certainly be at home till one     donwell!  cried his wife    my dear mr  e   you have not been to donwell!  you mean the crown  you come from the meeting at the crown     no  no  that  to morrow  and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account   such a dreadful broiling morning!   i went over the fields too   speaking in a tone of great ill usage   which made it so much the worse   and then not to find him at home! i assure you i am not at all pleased   and no apology left  no message for me   the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected    very extraordinary!  and nobody knew at all which way he was gone  perhaps to hartfield  perhaps to the abbey mill  perhaps into his woods    miss woodhouse  this is not like our friend knightley!  can you explain it    emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary  indeed  and that she had not a syllable to say for him    i cannot imagine   said mrs  elton   feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do    i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you  of all people in the world!  the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!  my dear mr  e   he must have left a message for you  i am sure he must   not even knightley could be so very eccentric    and his servants forgot it   depend upon it  that was the case  and very likely to happen with the donwell servants  who are all  i have often observed  extremely awkward and remiss   i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration   and as for mrs  hodges  wright holds her very cheap indeed   she promised wright a receipt  and never sent it     i met william larkins   continued mr  elton   as i got near the house  and he told me i should not find his master at home  but i did not believe him   william seemed rather out of humour  he did not know what was come to his master lately  he said  but he could hardly ever get the speech of him   i have nothing to do with william  wants  but it really is of very great importance that  i  should see knightley to day  and it becomes a matter  therefore  of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose    emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly  in all probability she was at this very time waited for there  and mr  knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr  elton  if not towards william larkins   she was pleased  on taking leave  to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room  to go with her even downstairs  it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of  to say    it is as well  perhaps  that i have not had the possibility  had you not been surrounded by other friends  i might have been tempted to introduce a subject  to ask questions  to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct   i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent     oh!  cried jane  with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure   there would have been no danger   the danger would have been of my wearying you   you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest     indeed  miss woodhouse   speaking more collectedly   with the consciousness which i have of misconduct  very great misconduct  it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends  whose good opinion is most worth preserving  are not disgusted to such a degree as to  i have not time for half that i could wish to say  i long to make apologies  excuses  to urge something for myself  i feel it so very due   but  unfortunately  in short  if your compassion does not stand my friend      oh! you are too scrupulous  indeed you are   cried emma warmly  and taking her hand    you owe me no apologies  and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them  is so perfectly satisfied  so delighted even      you are very kind  but i know what my manners were to you    so cold and artificial!  i had always a part to act   it was a life of deceit!  i know that i must have disgusted you     pray say no more   i feel that all the apologies should be on my side  let us forgive each other at once   we must do whatever is to be done quickest  and i think our feelings will lose no time there  i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor     very     and the next news  i suppose  will be  that we are to lose you   just as i begin to know you     oh! as to all that  of course nothing can be thought of yet  i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs  campbell     nothing can be actually settled yet  perhaps   replied emma  smiling   but  excuse me  it must be thought of    the smile was returned as jane answered    you are very right  it has been thought of   and i will own to you   i am sure it will be safe   that so far as our living with mr  churchill at enscombe  it is settled   there must be three months  at least  of deep mourning  but when they are over  i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for     thank you  thank you   this is just what i wanted to be assured of    oh! if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open!   good bye  good bye      chapter xvii   mrs  weston  friends were all made happy by her safety  and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to emma  it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl  she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston   she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her  hereafter  with either of isabella  sons  but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best  it would be a great comfort to mr  weston  as he grew older   and even mr  weston might be growing older ten years hence  to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense  the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home  and mrs  weston   no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her  and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach  should not have their powers in exercise again    she has had the advantage  you know  of practising on me   she continued   like la baronne d'almane on la comtesse d'ostalis  in madame de genlis' adelaide and theodore  and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan     that is   replied mr  knightley   she will indulge her even more than she did you  and believe that she does not indulge her at all  it will be the only difference     poor child!  cried emma   at that rate  what will become of her     nothing very bad   the fate of thousands   she will be disagreeable in infancy  and correct herself as she grows older   i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children  my dearest emma  i  who am owing all my happiness to  you   would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them    emma laughed  and replied    but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people  i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it     do you   i have no doubt   nature gave you understanding    miss taylor gave you principles   you must have done well  my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good   it was very natural for you to say  what right has he to lecture me    and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner   i do not believe i did you any good  the good was all to myself  by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me   i could not think about you so much without doating on you  faults and all  and by dint of fancying so many errors  have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least     i am sure you were of use to me   cried emma    i was very often influenced rightly by you  oftener than i would own at the time  i am very sure you did me good   and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled  it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me  except falling in love with her when she is thirteen     how often  when you were a girl  have you said to me  with one of your saucy looks  `mr  knightley  i am going to do so and so  papa says i may  or i have miss taylor  leave'  something which  you knew  i did not approve   in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one     what an amiable creature i was!  no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance     `mr  knightley '  you always called me  `mr  knightley ' and  from habit  it has not so very formal a sound   and yet it is formal  i want you to call me something else  but i do not know what     i remember once calling you `george ' in one of my amiable fits  about ten years ago   i did it because i thought it would offend you  but  as you made no objection  i never did it again     and cannot you call me `george' now     impossible!  i never can call you any thing but `mr  knightley ' i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs  elton  by calling you mr  k   but i will promise   she added presently  laughing and blushing   i will promise to call you once by your christian name   i do not say when  but perhaps you may guess where   in the building in which n  takes m  for better  for worse    emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her  to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies  her wilful intimacy with harriet smith  but it was too tender a subject   she could not enter on it    harriet was very seldom mentioned between them   this  on his side  might merely proceed from her not being thought of  but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy  and a suspicion  from some appearances  that their friendship were declining  she was aware herself  that  parting under any other circumstances  they certainly should have corresponded more  and that her intelligence would not have rested  as it now almost wholly did  on isabella  letters   he might observe that it was so   the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him  was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy   isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits  which appeared perfectly natural  as there was a dentist to be consulted  but  since that business had been over  she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before    isabella  to be sure  was no very quick observer  yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children  it would not have escaped her   emma  comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on  by harriet  being to stay longer  her fortnight was likely to be a month at least   mr  and mrs  john knightley were to come down in august  and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back    john does not even mention your friend   said mr  knightley   here is his answer  if you like to see it    it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage  emma accepted it with a very eager hand  with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it  and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned    john enters like a brother into my happiness   continued mr  knightley   but he is no complimenter  and though i well know him to have  likewise  a most brotherly affection for you  he is so far from making flourishes  that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise   but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes     he writes like a sensible man   replied emma  when she had read the letter    i honour his sincerity   it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side  but that he is not without hope of my growing  in time  as worthy of your affection  as you think me already   had he said any thing to bear a different construction  i should not have believed him     my emma  he means no such thing   he only means      he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two   interrupted she  with a sort of serious smile   much less  perhaps  than he is aware of  if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject     emma  my dear emma      oh!  she cried with more thorough gaiety   if you fancy your brother does not do me justice  only wait till my dear father is in the secret  and hear his opinion   depend upon it  he will be much farther from doing  you  justice   he will think all the happiness  all the advantage  on your side of the question  all the merit on mine   i wish i may not sink into `poor emma' with him at once    his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther     ah!  he cried   i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be  of our having every right that equal worth can give  to be happy together   i am amused by one part of john  letter   did you notice it   where he says  that my information did not take him wholly by surprize  that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind     if i understand your brother  he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying   he had no idea of me   he seems perfectly unprepared for that     yes  yes  but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings   what has he been judging by   i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another    but it was so  i suppose   i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day   i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual   i remember one evening the poor boys saying  `uncle seems always tired now '   the time was coming when the news must spread farther  and other persons' reception of it tried   as soon as mrs  weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr  woodhouse  visits  emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause  resolved first to announce it at home  and then at randalls    but how to break it to her father at last!  she had bound herself to do it  in such an hour of mr  knightley  absence  or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her  and she must have put it off  but mr  knightley was to come at such a time  and follow up the beginning she was to make   she was forced to speak  and to speak cheerfully too   she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him  by a melancholy tone herself  she must not appear to think it a misfortune   with all the spirits she could command  she prepared him first for something strange  and then  in a few words  said  that if his consent and approbation could be obtained  which  she trusted  would be attended with no difficulty  since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all   she and mr  knightley meant to marry  by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person  company whom she knew he loved  next to his daughters and mrs  weston  best in the world   poor man!  it was at first a considerable shock to him  and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it   she was reminded  more than once  of having always said she would never marry  and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single  and told of poor isabella  and poor miss taylor   but it would not do   emma hung about him affectionately  and smiled  and said it must be so  and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs  weston  whose marriages taking them from hartfield  had  indeed  made a melancholy change  but she was not going from hartfield  she should be always there  she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better  and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr  knightley always at hand  when he were once got used to the idea   did he not love mr  knightley very much    he would not deny that he did  she was sure   whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr  knightley   who was so useful to him  who so ready to write his letters  who so glad to assist him    who so cheerful  so attentive  so attached to him   would not he like to have him always on the spot   yes   that was all very true  mr  knightley could not be there too often  he should be glad to see him every day   but they did see him every day as it was   why could not they go on as they had done   mr  woodhouse could not be soon reconciled  but the worst was overcome  the idea was given  time and continual repetition must do the rest    to emma  entreaties and assurances succeeded mr  knightley   whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome  and he was soon used to be talked to by each  on every fair occasion    they had all the assistance which isabella could give  by letters of the strongest approbation  and mrs  weston was ready  on the first meeting  to consider the subject in the most serviceable light  first  as a settled  and  secondly  as a good one   well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr  woodhouse  mind   it was agreed upon  as what was to be  and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness  and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it  he began to think that some time or other   in another year or two  perhaps  it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place   mrs  weston was acting no part  feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event   she had been extremely surprized  never more so  than when emma first opened the affair to her  but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all  and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost   she had such a regard for mr  knightley  as to think he deserved even her dearest emma  and it was in every respect so proper  suitable  and unexceptionable a connexion  and in one respect  one point of the highest importance  so peculiarly eligible  so singularly fortunate  that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature  and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it  and wished it long ago   how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield!  and who but mr  knightley could know and bear with mr  woodhouse  so as to make such an arrangement desirable!   the difficulty of disposing of poor mr  woodhouse had been always felt in her husband  plans and her own  for a marriage between frank and emma   how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment  less acknowledged by mr  weston than by herself  but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying   those matters will take care of themselves  the young people will find a way    but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future   it was all right  all open  all equal   no sacrifice on any side worth the name  it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself  and without one real  rational difficulty to oppose or delay it   mrs  weston  with her baby on her knee  indulging in such reflections as these  was one of the happiest women in the world   if any thing could increase her delight  it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps   the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread  and mr  weston had his five minutes share of it  but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind    he saw the advantages of the match  and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife  but the wonder of it was very soon nothing  and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it    it is to be a secret  i conclude   said he    these matters are always a secret  till it is found out that every body knows them  only let me be told when i may speak out   i wonder whether jane has any suspicion    he went to highbury the next morning  and satisfied himself on that point   he told her the news   was not she like a daughter  his eldest daughter   he must tell her  and miss bates being present  it passed  of course  to mrs  cole  mrs  perry  and mrs  elton  immediately afterwards   it was no more than the principals were prepared for  they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls  how soon it would be over highbury  and were thinking of themselves  as the evening wonder in many a family circle  with great sagacity   in general  it was a very well approved match   some might think him  and others might think her  the most in luck   one set might recommend their all removing to donwell  and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys  and another might predict disagreements among their servants  but yet  upon the whole  there was no serious objection raised  except in one habitation  the vicarage   there  the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction   mr  elton cared little about it  compared with his wife  he only hoped  the young lady  pride would now be contented   and supposed  she had always meant to catch knightley if she could   and  on the point of living at hartfield  could daringly exclaim   rather he than i!    but mrs  elton was very much discomposed indeed    poor knightley! poor fellow!  sad business for him   she was extremely concerned  for  though very eccentric  he had a thousand good qualities    how could he be so taken in   did not think him at all in love   not in the least   poor knightley!  there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him   how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him!  but that would be all over now    poor fellow!  no more exploring parties to donwell made for  her   oh! no  there would be a mrs  knightley to throw cold water on every thing   extremely disagreeable!  but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day   shocking plan  living together   it would never do   she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it  and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter     chapter xviii   time passed on   a few more to morrows  and the party from london would be arriving   it was an alarming change  and emma was thinking of it one morning  as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her  when mr  knightley came in  and distressing thoughts were put by   after the first chat of pleasure he was silent  and then  in a graver tone  began with    i have something to tell you  emma  some news     good or bad   said she  quickly  looking up in his face    i do not know which it ought to be called     oh! good i am sure   i see it in your countenance   you are trying not to smile     i am afraid   said he  composing his features   i am very much afraid  my dear emma  that you will not smile when you hear it     indeed! but why so   i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you  should not please and amuse me too     there is one subject   he replied   i hope but one  on which we do not think alike    he paused a moment  again smiling  with his eyes fixed on her face    does nothing occur to you    do not you recollect   harriet smith    her cheeks flushed at the name  and she felt afraid of something  though she knew not what    have you heard from her yourself this morning   cried he   you have  i believe  and know the whole     no  i have not  i know nothing  pray tell me     you are prepared for the worst  i see  and very bad it is  harriet smith marries robert martin    emma gave a start  which did not seem like being prepared   and her eyes  in eager gaze  said   no  this is impossible!  but her lips were closed    it is so  indeed   continued mr  knightley   i have it from robert martin himself   he left me not half an hour ago    she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement    you like it  my emma  as little as i feared   i wish our opinions were the same   but in time they will   time  you may be sure  will make one or the other of us think differently  and  in the meanwhile  we need not talk much on the subject     you mistake me  you quite mistake me   she replied  exerting herself   it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy  but i cannot believe it   it seems an impossibility!  you cannot mean to say  that harriet smith has accepted robert martin   you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again  yet   you only mean  that he intends it     i mean that he has done it   answered mr  knightley  with smiling but determined decision   and been accepted     good god!  she cried    well!   then having recourse to her workbasket  in excuse for leaning down her face  and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing  she added   well  now tell me every thing  make this intelligible to me   how  where  when   let me know it all  i never was more surprized  but it does not make me unhappy  i assure you   how  how has it been possible     it is a very simple story   he went to town on business three days ago  and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john   he delivered these papers to john  at his chambers  and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley   they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley   the party was to be our brother and sister  henry  john  and miss smith  my friend robert could not resist   they called for him in their way  were all extremely amused  and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day  which he did  and in the course of that visit  as i understand  he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet  and certainly did not speak in vain   she made him  by her acceptance  as happy even as he is deserving   he came down by yesterday  coach  and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast  to report his proceedings  first on my affairs  and then on his own  this is all that i can relate of the how  where  and when  your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her    she will give you all the minute particulars  which only woman  language can make interesting   in our communications we deal only in the great   however  i must say  that robert martin  heart seemed for  him   and to  me   very overflowing  and that he did mention  without its being much to the purpose  that on quitting their box at astley   my brother took charge of mrs  john knightley and little john  and he followed with miss smith and henry  and that at one time they were in such a crowd  as to make miss smith rather uneasy    he stopped   emma dared not attempt any immediate reply   to speak  she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness   she must wait a moment  or he would think her mad  her silence disturbed him  and after observing her a little while  he added    emma  my love  you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected  his situation is an evil  but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend  and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more   his good sense and good principles would delight you   as far as the man is concerned  you could not wish your friend in better hands   his rank in society i would alter if i could  which is saying a great deal i assure you  emma   you laugh at me about william larkins  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin    he wanted her to look up and smile  and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly  she did  cheerfully answering    you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match   i think harriet is doing extremely well    her  connexions may be worse than  his   in respectability of character  there can be no doubt that they are  i have been silent from surprize merely  excessive surprize  you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared i was!  for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him  much more  than she was before     you ought to know your friend best   replied mr  knightley   but i should say she was a good tempered  soft hearted girl  not likely to be very  very determined against any young man who told her he loved her    emma could not help laughing as she answered   upon my word  i believe you know her quite as well as i do   but  mr  knightley  are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright  accepted  him   i could suppose she might in time  but can she already    did not you misunderstand him   you were both talking of other things  of business  shows of cattle  or new drills  and might not you  in the confusion of so many subjects  mistake him   it was not harriet  hand that he was certain of  it was the dimensions of some famous ox    the contrast between the countenance and air of mr  knightley and robert martin was  at this moment  so strong to emma  feelings  and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet  side  so fresh the sound of those words  spoken with such emphasis   no  i hope i know better than to think of robert martin   that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove  in some measure  premature   it could not be otherwise    do you dare say this   cried mr  knightley    do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead  as not to know what a man is talking of    what do you deserve     oh!  i always deserve the best treatment  because i never put up with any other  and  therefore  you must give me a plain  direct answer   are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr  martin and harriet now are     i am quite sure   he replied  speaking very distinctly   that he told me she had accepted him  and that there was no obscurity  nothing doubtful  in the words he used  and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so   he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do   he knew of no one but mrs  goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends   could i mention any thing more fit to be done  than to go to mrs  goddard  i assured him that i could not   then  he said  he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day     i am perfectly satisfied   replied emma  with the brightest smiles   and most sincerely wish them happy     you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before     i hope so  for at that time i was a fool     and i am changed also  for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet  good qualities   i have taken some pains for your sake  and for robert martin  sake   whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever   to get acquainted with her  i have often talked to her a good deal   you must have seen that i did   sometimes  indeed  i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin  cause  which was never the case  but  from all my observations  i am convinced of her being an artless  amiable girl  with very good notions  very seriously good principles  and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life    much of this  i have no doubt  she may thank you for     me!  cried emma  shaking her head    ah! poor harriet!   she checked herself  however  and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved   their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father   she was not sorry   she wanted to be alone   her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder  which made it impossible for her to be collected   she was in dancing  singing  exclaiming spirits  and till she had moved about  and talked to herself  and laughed and reflected  she could be fit for nothing rational   her father  business was to announce james  being gone out to put the horses to  preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls  and she had  therefore  an immediate excuse for disappearing   the joy  the gratitude  the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined   the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet  welfare  she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security   what had she to wish for   nothing  but to grow more worthy of him  whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own   nothing  but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future   serious she was  very serious in her thankfulness  and in her resolutions  and yet there was no preventing a laugh  sometimes in the very midst of them   she must laugh at such a close!  such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back!  such a heart  such a harriet!  now there would be pleasure in her returning  every thing would be a pleasure   it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin   high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities  was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr  knightley would soon be over   the disguise  equivocation  mystery  so hateful to her to practise  might soon be over  she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty   in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father  not always listening  but always agreeing to what he said  and  whether in speech or silence  conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day  or poor mrs  weston would be disappointed   they arrived   mrs  weston was alone in the drawing room    but hardly had they been told of the baby  and mr  woodhouse received the thanks for coming  which he asked for  when a glimpse was caught through the blind  of two figures passing near the window    it is frank and miss fairfax   said mrs  weston    i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning   he stays till to morrow  and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us   they are coming in  i hope    in half a minute they were in the room   emma was extremely glad to see him  but there was a degree of confusion  a number of embarrassing recollections on each side   they met readily and smiling  but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said  and having all sat down again  there was for some time such a blank in the circle  that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged  which she had long felt  of seeing frank churchill once more  and of seeing him with jane  would yield its proportion of pleasure  when mr  weston joined the party  however  and when the baby was fetched  there was no longer a want of subject or animation   or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say    i have to thank you  miss woodhouse  for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs  weston  letters   i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon   i hope you do not retract what you then said     no  indeed   cried emma  most happy to begin   not in the least  i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you  and to give you joy in person    he thanked her with all his heart  and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness    is not she looking well   said he  turning his eyes towards jane   better than she ever used to do   you see how my father and mrs  weston doat upon her    but his spirits were soon rising again  and with laughing eyes  after mentioning the expected return of the campbells  he named the name of dixon   emma blushed  and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing    i can never think of it   she cried   without extreme shame     the shame   he answered   is all mine  or ought to be   but is it possible that you had no suspicion   i mean of late   early  i know  you had none     i never had the smallest  i assure you     that appears quite wonderful   i was once very near  and i wish i had   it would have been better   but though i was always doing wrong things  they were very bad wrong things  and such as did me no service    it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing     it is not now worth a regret   said emma    i have some hope   resumed he   of my uncle  being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls  he wants to be introduced to her  when the campbells are returned  we shall meet them in london  and continue there  i trust  till we may carry her northward   but now  i am at such a distance from her  is not it hard  miss woodhouse    till this morning  we have not once met since the day of reconciliation  do not you pity me    emma spoke her pity so very kindly  that with a sudden accession of gay thought  he cried    ah! by the bye   then sinking his voice  and looking demure for the moment   i hope mr  knightley is well    he paused   she coloured and laughed    i know you saw my letter  and think you may remember my wish in your favour   let me return your congratulations    i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction   he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise    emma was delighted  and only wanted him to go on in the same style  but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane  and his next words were    did you ever see such a skin   such smoothness! such delicacy!   and yet without being actually fair   one cannot call her fair  it is a most uncommon complexion  with her dark eye lashes and hair   a most distinguishing complexion!  so peculiarly the lady in it    just colour enough for beauty     i have always admired her complexion   replied emma  archly   but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale    when we first began to talk of her   have you quite forgotten     oh! no  what an impudent dog i was!  how could i dare     but he laughed so heartily at the recollection  that emma could not help saying    i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time  you had very great amusement in tricking us all   i am sure you had    i am sure it was a consolation to you     oh! no  no  no  how can you suspect me of such a thing  i was the most miserable wretch!    not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth   i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you  to feel that you were taking us all in   perhaps i am the readier to suspect  because  to tell you the truth  i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation   i think there is a little likeness between us    he bowed    if not in our dispositions   she presently added  with a look of true sensibility   there is a likeness in our destiny  the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own     true  true   he answered  warmly    no  not true on your side   you can have no superior  but most true on mine   she is a complete angel  look at her   is not she an angel in every gesture   observe the turn of her throat   observe her eyes  as she is looking up at my father    you will be glad to hear  inclining his head  and whispering seriously  that my uncle means to give her all my aunt  jewels   they are to be new set   i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head  will not it be beautiful in her dark hair     very beautiful  indeed   replied emma  and she spoke so kindly  that he gratefully burst out    how delighted i am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent looks!  i would not have missed this meeting for the world  i should certainly have called at hartfield  had you failed to come    the others had been talking of the child  mrs  weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under  the evening before  from the infant  appearing not quite well   she believed she had been foolish  but it had alarmed her  and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr  perry   perhaps she ought to be ashamed  but mr  weston had been almost as uneasy as herself   in ten minutes  however  the child had been perfectly well again   this was her history  and particularly interesting it was to mr  woodhouse  who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry  and only regretted that she had not done it    she should always send for perry  if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered  were it only for a moment   she could not be too soon alarmed  nor send for perry too often   it was a pity  perhaps  that he had not come last night  for  though the child seemed well now  very well considering  it would probably have been better if perry had seen it    frank churchill caught the name    perry!  said he to emma  and trying  as he spoke  to catch miss fairfax  eye    my friend mr  perry!  what are they saying about mr  perry   has he been here this morning   and how does he travel now   has he set up his carriage    emma soon recollected  and understood him  and while she joined in the laugh  it was evident from jane  countenance that she too was really hearing him  though trying to seem deaf    such an extraordinary dream of mine!  he cried    i can never think of it without laughing   she hears us  she hears us  miss woodhouse  i see it in her cheek  her smile  her vain attempt to frown  look at her   do not you see that  at this instant  the very passage of her own letter  which sent me the report  is passing under her eye   that the whole blunder is spread before her  that she can attend to nothing else  though pretending to listen to the others    jane was forced to smile completely  for a moment  and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him  and said in a conscious  low  yet steady voice    how you can bear such recollections  is astonishing to me!   they  will  sometimes obtrude  but how you can court them!   he had a great deal to say in return  and very entertainingly  but emma  feelings were chiefly with jane  in the argument  and on leaving randalls  and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men  she felt  that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill  and really regarding him as she did with friendship  she had never been more sensible of mr  knightley  high superiority of character  the happiness of this most happy day  received its completion  in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced     chapter xix   if emma had still  at intervals  an anxious feeling for harriet  a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr  knightley  and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination  it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty  a very few days brought the party from london  and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet  than she became perfectly satisfied  unaccountable as it was!   that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr  knightley  and was now forming all her views of happiness   harriet was a little distressed  did look a little foolish at first  but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly  and self deceived  before  her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words  and leave her without a care for the past  and with the fullest exultation in the present and future  for  as to her friend  approbation  emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature  by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations    harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley   and the dinner the next day  she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight   but what did such particulars explain    the fact was  as emma could now acknowledge  that harriet had always liked robert martin  and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible   beyond this  it must ever be unintelligible to emma   the event  however  was most joyful  and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so   harriet  parentage became known  she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman  rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers  and decent enough to have always wished for concealment   such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!   it was likely to be as untainted  perhaps  as the blood of many a gentleman   but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr  knightley  or for the churchills  or even for mr  elton!   the stain of illegitimacy  unbleached by nobility or wealth  would have been a stain indeed   no objection was raised on the father  side  the young man was treated liberally  it was all as it should be   and as emma became acquainted with robert martin  who was now introduced at hartfield  she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend   she had no doubt of harriet  happiness with any good tempered man  but with him  and in the home he offered  there would be the hope of more  of security  stability  and improvement   she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her  and who had better sense than herself  retired enough for safety  and occupied enough for cheerfulness  she would be never led into temptation  nor left for it to find her out  she would be respectable and happy  and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world  to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man   or  if not quite the luckiest  to yield only to herself   harriet  necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins  was less and less at hartfield  which was not to be regretted    the intimacy between her and emma must sink  their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill  and  fortunately  what ought to be  and must be  seemed already beginning  and in the most gradual  natural manner   before the end of september  emma attended harriet to church  and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction  as no remembrances  even connected with mr  elton as he stood before them  could impair   perhaps  indeed  at that time she scarcely saw mr  elton  but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself   robert martin and harriet smith  the latest couple engaged of the three  were the first to be married   jane fairfax had already quitted highbury  and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells   the mr  churchills were also in town  and they were only waiting for november   the intermediate month was the one fixed on  as far as they dared  by emma and mr  knightley   they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield  to allow them the fortnight  absence in a tour to the seaside  which was the plan   john and isabella  and every other friend  were agreed in approving it   but mr  woodhouse  how was mr  woodhouse to be induced to consent   he  who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event   when first sounded on the subject  he was so miserable  that they were almost hopeless   a second allusion  indeed  gave less pain    he began to think it was to be  and that he could not prevent it   a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation  still  however  he was not happy   nay  he appeared so much otherwise  that his daughter  courage failed   she could not bear to see him suffering  to know him fancying himself neglected  and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr  knightleys  that when once the event were over  his distress would be soon over too  she hesitated  she could not proceed   in this state of suspense they were befriended  not by any sudden illumination of mr  woodhouse  mind  or any wonderful change of his nervous system  but by the operation of the same system in another way    mrs  weston  poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys   evidently by the ingenuity of man   other poultry yards in the neighbourhood also suffered   pilfering was  housebreaking  to mr  woodhouse  fears   he was very uneasy  and but for the sense of his son in law  protection  would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life   the strength  resolution  and presence of mind of the mr  knightleys  commanded his fullest dependence  while either of them protected him and his  hartfield was safe    but mr  john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november   the result of this distress was  that  with a much more voluntary  cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment  she was able to fix her wedding day  and mr  elton was called on  within a month from the marriage of mr  and mrs  robert martin  to join the hands of mr  knightley and miss woodhouse   the wedding was very much like other weddings  where the parties have no taste for finery or parade  and mrs  elton  from the particulars detailed by her husband  thought it all extremely shabby  and very inferior to her own    very little white satin  very few lace veils  a most pitiful business!  selina would stare when she heard of it    but  in spite of these deficiencies  the wishes  the hopes  the confidence  the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony  were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union    finis \""
